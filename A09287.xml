            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If ſo, how can his Catholique Reader at the firſt ſight, by the ſame, refute our doctrines?

            </p>
            <p>Like a doughty daring Champion, or grand <hi>Goliah,</hi> vpon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing his banner of manifold Scripture-proofes for the Romane cauſe, he proclaimeth of and againſt our partie, that <hi>all the packe of them put together, is neuer able in their defence to doe the like, that is, to produce ſo many places in number, ſo expreſſe and cleare, and for ſo great a quantitie of controuerſies.</hi> I wiſh that this <hi>Thraſo</hi> had to the 276. places by him cited out of our Bible, added but this one, <hi>Let not him that girdeth on his harneſſe,</hi>

            <p>Among this packe (as he is pleaſed in his peddling eloquence to ſtile vs) I acknowledge my ſelfe to be of the meaneſt and courſeſt ſtuffe, farre inferiour to moſt of my learned and iudicious brethren, who are able with one finger, not only to gagg, but alſo to choake this babbler. Yet ſhould I thinke my ſelfe vnfit to beare the name of a Miniſter in this Reformed and Renowned Church of <hi>England,</hi> if vpon one curſory view of ſome parts of the Scriptures, I were not able to obſerue and ranke out more pertinently, and with better conſcience, and directer conſequence, many more authorities and arguments for the defence of our Church, and beating downe Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then he hath pretended to doe on the contrary.</p>
            <p>True it is, that my principall calling and daily endeuour is (like <hi>Dauids</hi> in his minoritie) to keepe and attend ſheepe in the Countrey, my furniture is rather the Crooke and Scripp, then the Sword or Sling.

            <p>Plaine Shepheardly <hi>Dauid,</hi> had he truſted in his owne ſtrength, and not rather in the goodneſſe of his cauſe, being Gods quarrell, might eaſily haue been diſcouraged not onely by the braues and threats of the <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> but much more by the checks and ſnappes of his elder brother <hi>Eliab;</hi> who (perhaps being better furniſhed with abilities both for warre, and for Court) thought to frowne his rurall brother out of the field. But God is pleaſed to aduance his truth and cauſe the rather by plaine and weake meanes. For my part, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath moued me to this encounter, but the zeale of Gods truth, and deſire to inſtruct the meaner ſort, and eſtabliſh our leſſe learned Chriſtian brethren. As for curioſities and ſubtill contemplations, I leaue them vnto others, or rather to be left of all others, ſo farre as they tend to engendring of ſtrife among our ſelues, and preiudice to our Church. And accordingly in preſſing the paſſages of Scripture, and vindicating the ſame from violent and abſurd interpretations, I haue laboured to deliuer the plaine, true, and natiue expoſition, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the literall ſenſe, and naturall context, together with the circumſtances thereof. Which manner of interpretation, as moſt ſound and ſolid, hath in all ages, and will find approbation with the iudicious.</p>
            <p>As for the ſtile and words of Scriptures, I deſire (as this aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie dealt with vs by way of repercuſſion,) ſo to repay him in coine of his owne ſtampe: and therefore I ſtill pleade out of their owne vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Engliſh Tranſlation of the whole Bible, written and perfited by the Seminary Prieſts at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> as appeareth by the firſt words of their Preface to the New Teſtament printed there. Though the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part thereof, being the old Testament, was afterward printed at <hi>Doway,</hi> and thereupon is commonly called the <hi>Doway Bible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Rhemiſts Prieſts,</hi> for making any Tranſlation at all of the Bible into the Engliſh tongue (though out of the vulgar Latine, though obſcured by affected phraſes, and diſtorted by their corrupt Annotations) yet are ſaid to haue bin beſhrewed by their owne more ſubtile Maſters and Superiours, as hauing thereby layed open to the people the nakedneſſe and deformitie of their Romiſh doctrines. And therefore haue I the more willingly produced the ſame againſt themſelues; the power and luſtre of Gods Word, though clouded and diſguiſed by their purpoſed obſcuritie and improprieties, yet

                  <hi>I. Poſition.</hi> There is one, and but one onely rule of our Chriſtian faith.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His, euen their owne Bible of Doway and Rhemes, teacheth, it doth not make mention of rules, but ſpeakes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſingularly as of one rule, Rom. 12. 6. Gal. 6. 16. and of the ſame rule, Phil. 3. 16. Seeing alſo that there is but one God, one Lord, one Spirit, one body, (or Church) one Faith, one Hope, one Baptiſme, Epheſ. 4. 4, 5. 1. Cor. 12. 4, 5, 6. how can there be more then one Rule? The ancient Fathers ſpeake of no more then one, as afterwards ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>And reaſon may tell vs, that a competent rule can be but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, to that whereof it is a rule, the ſame alſo an entire and perfect rule, and not partiall, or a rule onely in part.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1814:9"/>
               <p>For if the rule be not one, but two for one and the ſame thing; then they muſt either agree, and ſo are they but one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire: or elſe they differ: if ſo in any thing, then cannot they be both rules for one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>For then <hi>res regulata,</hi> the thing ruled, muſt differ from it ſelfe, in being framed to the difference of the rules betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: now, the rules diſagreeing, what can accord them? or what can they agreeingly meaſure, when they are themſelues at odds?</p>
               <p>If any one ſay, that the one may be a rule to the other; then there ſhould be a rule of a rule, and ſo run in <hi>infinitum,</hi> whereof there is no certain knowledge; and ſo no ſure rule for any thing.</p>
               <p>If it be granted, as needs it muſt, that a rule is onely one, and that there cannot be either two rules for one thing, or a rule of a rule; yet perhaps it will be ſaid, that one and the ſame rule may haue two parts, whereof neither part is a perfit rule of it ſelfe, but both together make a full rule.</p>
               <p>But this cannot be: For if it bee a rule in part, then is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and needs a ſupply, but an imperfit rule there is not, be it neuer ſo ſhort. For ſuppoſe an inch, or an halfe inch rule, yet is it as true, as full, and as perfit a rule, as truly meaſuring that to which it is laid, as the rule of an ell long, though it cannot mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo much at once.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1814:10"/> to him., Firſt, by this Word of God was <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> guided, as the Hiſtory ſheweth, if we conſider theſe places, where God is ſaid to ſpeake vnto them, giuing them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Gen. 12. 1. and 13. 17. and 15. 1. and 17. 9, 10. and 31. 3. and 35. 1. Secondly, making them promiſes, Gen. 12 2, 3, 4, 7. and 13. 15, 16. and 15. 5, 13, 18. Thirdly, their going to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of God, Gen. 25. 2. Exod. 18. 15. Fourthly, Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending their obedience in keeping his way, charge, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, ſtatutes and lawes, Gen. 18. 19. and 26. 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>When Moſes was appointed by God to guide the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> they were exhorted to hearken to Gods voyce, and to his commandements, Exod. 15. 26. they iournyed towards Canaan <hi>according to the commandement of the Lord,</hi> Exod. 17. 1. And concerning <hi>Moſes</hi> this is ſaid of him, <hi>that according to all the Lord commanded, ſo did he,</hi> Exod. 40. 16. He ſpake that which was commanded him, Exod. 34. 34. Deut. 4. 5, 14. and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all that the Lord had giuen him in commandement, Deut. 1. 3. and made them know the Statutes of God and his Lawes, Exod. 18. 16. The Tabernacle was for the parts, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, manner and end, in all and euery thing exactly done, onely according to Gods Word, and the patterne ſhewed him from God, Exod. 25. 9, 40. nothing left to <hi>Moſes</hi> deuice, Exod. 26. 30. and 27. 8. So was the Temple built afterwards by Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and direction onely, 1. Chr. 28. 11, 12, 19. 1. King. 6. 38. 2. Chron. 3. 3. The Prophets taught onely the Word of the Lord, Ezech. 3. 4. for they ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord; Heare the Word of the Lord,</hi> when they executed their Miniſtery, and <hi>they ſpake as they were moued by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 20. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah 9. 30. Heb. 1. 1.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>When Chriſt came,</hi> he ſpake not of himſelfe, Ioh. 12. 49. not his owne words, Ioh. 40. 10. and 17. 8. neither was his doctrine his owne, Ioh. 7. 16. and 14. 24. he did nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Ioh. 8. 28. and 5. 19. but hee taught the words of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Ioh. 17. 8. his Doctrine and Word was his that ſent him, Ioh. 7. 16. and 14. 24. what he had heard and ſeene with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that did hee ſpeake, Ioh. 8. 26. 38. of whom hee receiued a commandement what he ſhould ſay and ſpeak, Ioh. 12. 49. And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1814:10"/> 
                  <hi>before his Aſcenſion,</hi> chuſing his Apoſtles, he gaue them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and charge, to teach <hi>whatſoeuer he commanded them,</hi> Matth. 28. 20. and gaue them the words which his Father gaue vnto him, Ioh. 17. 8.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>After he was aſcended,</hi> according as he had promiſed, Ioh. 14. 26. hee ſent downe vpon his Apoſtles the holy Ghoſt, Act. 2. which Spirit of God ſpake not of himſelfe, but whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he heard, that he ſpake, Ioh. 16. 13. By this holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Father, ſpake the Apoſtles, Mat. 10. 20. Mark. 13. 1. which guided them into all truth, Ioh. 16. 13. teaching and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring them of all things, whatſoeuer Chriſt had ſaid vnto them, Ioh. 14. 26. So that what the holy Ghoſt taught them, was the Word of Chriſt, and Chriſts Word was the Word of the Father; thus ſtrictly was the Word of God obſerued.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>The holy Apoſtles</hi> obſerued this Rule, in whom, and by whom the holy Ghoſt did ſpeake, Mark. 13. 11. whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection they did follow, Act. 15. 28. and gaue themſelues to the Miniſtery of the Word, Acts 6. 4. preaching the Word of the Lord, Act. 8. 25. and 15. 35, 36. and 16. 32. what they did teach, was the <hi>Word of God,</hi> Acts 18. 11. and 19. 10, 20. the <hi>counſell of God,</hi> Act. 20. 27. <hi>the Goſpell of God,</hi> Rom. 1. 1. <hi>the commandements of the Lord,</hi> 1. Cor. 14. 37. deliuering what they had receiued from the Lord, 1. Cor. 11. 23. and 15. 3.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, <hi>That which the Church, and the Saints, and beleeuers heard, was the Word of the Lord,</hi> Acts 13. 44. this they receiued as Gods Word, 1. Theſ. 2. 13. and glorified the ſame, Act. 13. 40. Thus was Gods Word from the beginning, before the Law, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, in Chriſts time, and all the Apoſtles dayes, the Churches inſtruction and direction, and muſt be ſo vnto the worlds end. Therefore it is the onely infallible rule of our faith, by which we muſt euer be directed and guided.</p>

                  <hi>III. Poſition.</hi> This Word of God is now no where to be found, but in the holy Scriptures.</head>
               <p>THe truth of this will appeare, if we conſider, how God did cauſe all thoſe things which were neceſſary to be beleeued and practiſed of the Church, to bee afterwards written, which before had been deliuered by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Before the Law till Moſes,</hi> the Church was guided by Gods Word vnwritten: this we acknowledge, and the Papiſts ſeeke to make aduantage thereof, for an vnwritten Word ſtill: but their arguing hence is vaine, becauſe that all that ſame Word vnwritten <hi>in all neceſſarie points of the worſhip and ſeruice of God,</hi> was afterwards written by <hi>Moſes:</hi> ſo as that vnwritten Word became to be the written Word. The proofe of this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt wrote the ſame <hi>Hiſtorically</hi> in the bookes of Geneſis and Exodus, vnto the giuing of the Law vpon Mount Sinai, Exod. 20. which Law God himſelfe wrote, Exod. 31. 18. Afterwards <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the ſame <hi>by way of precept,</hi> which other of the Prophets after him explained and enlarged, as they were mooued by the holy Ghoſt. For the better clearing of this point, ſee the ſame more fully in the particulars.</p>

               <p>Thus we ſee, that what was firſt by tradition, was afterward particularly written; and ſo the vnwritten Word was the ſame with the written.</p>
               <p>Firſt alſo, before the Word was written with pen and ink, the whole moral law written in the hart, was to be obſerued, as may be ſhewed in the books of Geneſis, Exod. and <hi>Iob;</hi> as well as the ceremoniall Law and the Sacraments, Sacrifices, and other parts of Gods worſhip before mentioned: all which afterward were written in books. Therefore the traditionall Word before the Law written, helps nothing for a traditional Word now, ſeeing God would haue that ſame written afterwards; whereby of a traditionall Word, it became the written Word of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>in the time of Moſes,</hi> God ſpake to him, and hee to the people: but it is ſaid, that <hi>Moſes wrote all the words of the Lord,</hi> Exod. 24. 4. Deut. 31. 9, 19, 24. The Prophets alſo ſpake, firſt, by word of mouth, which were for the moſt part interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and more ſpeciall applications of the Word already written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which alſo were after written, as the bookes extant doe witneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>In the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles</hi> they taught by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1814:12"/> word of mouth the Word of God; but their Word was not then an vnwritten Word: For firſt, Chriſt taught out of the Scriptures of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of the Prophets &amp; Pſalmes, as his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Luk. 24.</note> of them, citing them, and confuting the aduerſaries by them doe ſhew: he therefore taught the written Word. And what he himſelf either did, or farther ſpake in all neceſſary things touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his life and doctrine, they are now written by the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, Luk. 1. 1, 5. Act. 1. 1. So in like manner the Apoſtles, before they wrote, taught not an vnwritten Word, but the Word and Goſpell, Acts 8. 25. and this ſame written in the Scriptures of the Prophets, Rom. 1. 1, 2. and 16. 26. Act. 26. 22. and 28. 23. According as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith; <hi>Whatſoeuer the Apoſtles prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Mat. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>in the Goſpell, they preached it by the words of the Law and the Prophets.</hi> For if they had preached any thing not in the Scriptures, it had been in vaine for the Bereans to haue ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scriptures daily, to ſee whether thoſe things which they had heard of them were ſo or no, Acts 17. 11. It is cleare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they taught a written Word: and what they receiued from Chriſt, and taught, for the effect and vſe thereof, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo afterward did write, as may bee gathered from theſe inſuing places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>In Rom. 15. 15. the Apoſtle wrote, <hi>putting them in mind;</hi> to wit, of that which had been taught them by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>In 1. Cor. 11. 23. he telleth them, that <hi>he deliuered (by word of mouth) that which he had receiued of the Lord:</hi> then hee wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe in the ſame verſe and the reſt following, that which he had receiued.</p>
               <p>In 1. Cor. 15. 1. he telleth them, that now by writing, he <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them the Goſpell which hee had preached, and which they had receiued:</hi> ſo that he wrote that, which before he had taught them.</p>
               <p>In 2. Cor. 1. 13. he ſaith, that <hi>hee wrote none other things vnto them, then that which they did reade, or did acknowledge.</hi>

               <p>In Phil. 3. 1. he <hi>wrote the ſame things;</hi> to wit, which hee had preached, it not being to him grieuous, and to them ſafe.</p>
               <p>In 2. Theſ. 2. 5. he ſaith; <hi>Remember yee not, that when I was with you, I told you theſe things?</hi> to wit, which hee then in that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1814:13"/> Epiſtle wrote: he wrote then, what by mouth hee had taught. And howſoeuer in the verſe 15. of this Chapter, he mentioneth Traditions, yet thoſe were ſuch, as were then by him written: there the word <hi>traditions</hi> is equally and alike referred to (<hi>word</hi>) and (<hi>epiſtle:</hi>) as if he had ſaid; If that I deliuered by word, bee forgotten, yet haue you now my Epiſtle, to keepe them in your mind; and therefore in verſ. 5. he ſaith; <hi>Remember yee not?</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing written downe in verſ. 3. and 4 what he before had told them, and ſo in verſ 6. proceeding to ſet downe the traditions before deliuered, vnto verſ. 13. Then writeth hee to them, to ſtand faſt, and keepe the traditions, taught by word before, or by his epiſtle now, as being all one and the ſame, deliuered <hi>now both by word and writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 2. Theſ. 3. 6. he there alſo makes mention of tradition: but what? of a tradition vnwritten? Yes, before it was written: but now <hi>Paul</hi> wrote it, as you may reade in verſ. 10. where hee telleth vs particularly what it was.</p>
               <p>In 2. Pet. 1. 12. Saint <hi>Peter endeuours to put them alwaies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that they might after his deceaſe keepe in mind alwaies the things which they knew,</hi> and the truth <hi>wherein they were ſettled;</hi> to wit, by his and others preaching. Now if he wrote not theſe things, they could not ſo well remember them after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And did <hi>Peter</hi> care onely for thoſe preſent, or for Gods Church after? If he did, then ſurely he ſo wrote, to remember thoſe preſent of that which they had learned, as the ſame might alſo inſtruct others in the ſame truth, ſuch as ſhould afterwards liue, and had neuer heard him by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>In 2. Pet. 3. 1, 2. Here Saint <hi>Peter</hi> telleth them, what was the end of writing both his Epiſtles, to wit, to remember them, and to mind them of two things, firſt, of the words which were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Prophets, and then, of the Commandements of the Apoſtles; he therefore wrote theſe.</p>
               <p>In 1. Ioh. 4. 13. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writes of Antichriſt, of whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had heard: and in Chap. 1. 3. he writeth what he had ſeene and taught before.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Iude,</hi> he writeth what they (to whom he ſends his Epiſtle) before knew, and had bin preached by the Apoſtles, v. 15. 17. 18.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1814:13"/>
               <p>Saint <hi>Luke</hi> writes thoſe things, which were deliuered by word of mouth, for the more certaintie of the things taught, Luk. 1. 2, 3, 4. euen of all that Chriſt began to doe, and to ſpeake, vnto his Aſcenſion, Act. 1. 1.</p>
               <p>By all theſe places it is cleare, that what was firſt taught, was afterwards written: and our aduerſaries cannot ſhew any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary point of faith, or of good life left out of the written Word, which as a point of doctrine before was deliuered by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for the Churches neceſſary inſtruction from the worlds beginning. To this the ancient Fathers giue witneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Irenaeus lib. 3. cap.</hi> 1. The Apoſtles preached the Goſpell, and afterwards by the wil of God, they deliuered it vnto vs in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be the pillar and ground of our faith. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> on Phil. 3. ſaith, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, that is, made rehearſall of the ſame things, which he, when he was preſent with them, had told them by mouth. <hi>Theophylact</hi> on <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. 1. ſpeakes in <hi>Lukes</hi> perſon, and ſaith, I inſtructed thee before without wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, now I deliuer vnto thee a written Goſpell, that thou mayeſt not forget thoſe things which were deliuered without writing. <hi>Nicephorus lib. 2. cap.</hi> 34. ſaith, that what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in preſence plainely taught by mouth, the ſame things afterward in abſence he called to their minds by his Epiſtle. And that this was not but by Gods commandement, S. <hi>Auſtine de conſenſ. Euangel. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 35. witneſſeth; When the Diſciples wrote, ſaith he, what Chriſt ſhewed and ſaid vnto them, wee may not ſay, that he did not write: for the members wrote that which they learned, by the inditing of the head. For whatſoeuer hee would haue vs to reade of the things which he did and ſaid, he gaue it in charge to them, as his hands to write the ſame. So that we may conclude that true, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2. Tim. 3. 16. both of all the old Teſtament, as alſo of all the new; and particularly of that very ſame place it ſelfe, when hee had written it, which is, <hi>that all Scripture is of diuine inſpiration;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he alſo wrote by diuine inſtinct, and by Chriſts commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and made this attribute of <hi>diuinely-inſpired,</hi> to be a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scriptures, and ſo all neceſſarie things being written which were taught, we muſt acknowledge the Word of God

Where note, 1. That the Bereans held not themſelues tyed to the Prieſts lips. 2. That they heard that which was taught them with relation to the written Word. 3. That they held the Scriptures to be the triall of the truth of their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doctrine. 4. That they hauing heard, did bring that which they had heard, to the touchſtone of holy Writ, for their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confirmation in the truth; which things are written for their praiſe, for our inſtruction alſo in imitation. For if the holy Scriptures of the old Teſtament, were then the rule to trie the Apoſtles preaching, is not both the Old and New, the rule to try mens teaching now?</p>

                  <p>2. The words <hi>hard to be vnderſtood,</hi> are to be referred to <hi>things,</hi>

                  <p>3. Its ſaid, that <hi>certaine things</hi> are hard to be vnderſtood, not all things; ſo that from ſome things to all things, is no good concluſion. And wee our ſelues confeſſe, that ſome things are hard to be vnderſtood, and ſome places, yea, many; but they are not ſo neceſſary to ſaluation. And in that which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Goſpell and ſauing knowledge, the obſcuritie is not in the ſtile of the Spirit, but in the peruerſitie and hardneſſe of mans heart, 2. Cor. 4. 3, 4 and 3. 14, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>4 Saint <hi>Peter</hi> by onely ſaying, that <hi>certaine things</hi> are hard, he yeelds, that all the reſt are eaſie to be vnderſtood: for excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely to ſome, cleareth the reſt from obſcuritie: and if for ſome things hard, they will conclude the obſcuritie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how much more may we conclude the cleareneſſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from the eaſineſſe to vnderſtand all the reſt? for all the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1814:24"/> points of life and ſaluation are in Scripture: and if onely ſome things be hard, then many things are eaſie; therefore from the great part of the Scripture eaſie to bee vnderſtood, we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude the Scriptures plainneſſe, then from ſome things hard, to put obſcuritie vpon all the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>5. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> telleth vs to whom, and to what ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons theſe hard things come to be miſtaken, yea, and not onely the hard, but alſo the reſt, the things eaſie to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; euen onely to the vnlearned and vnſtable. Therefore not to other which be learned and ſtable, ſuch as be taught of God, and doe conſtantly indeuour to know the Lords will. Is this good reaſoning, Some men vnderſtand not: <hi>Ergo,</hi> None can? Some abuſe the Scripture: <hi>Ergo,</hi> All doe?</p>
                  <p>6. To whom did <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles write? To whom were the Epiſtles ſent to bee read? Onely to the Clergie, or to the Laitie alſo? Verily to all ſorts, as we may reade, 1. Theſ. 5. 27. Col. 4. 16. And therefore they were not hard to be vnderſtood, but might be vnderſtood of all ſorts, elſe had it been vaine to reade them vnto all.</p>
                  <p>7. If we conſider it well, the Scriptures are cleare to all ſorts, as they come prepared to the reading thereof. Let the naturall man come with the Law within himſelfe, Rom. 2. 14. and with ſuch common principles as are left in all by nature, and he read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will find thoſe things eaſily, and with vnderſtanding ſpeake of them. Let the honeſt Moraliſt come and reade, and he will eaſily vnderſtand the places of vertues and vices, the examples of both, the threats and promiſes, the rewards &amp; puniſhments; in which things a great part of Scripture is ſpent. Let Artiſts come, one with the Grammar, and another with Logicke, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Rethorick, and they will ſee eaſily the Grammar, the Logick, the Rethorick therein contained; and ſo will other learned in other Sciences; The naturall Philoſopher will ſee the Philoſophy; they that haue skill in Lawes, in Military affaires, in Chronologies, and many other things, too long to recite, will ſee by their skill theſe things eaſily in the Scriptures. Now let in like manner a man indued with knowledge in Diuinitie, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ground of Chriſtianitie, and catechized
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1814:25"/> therein, come to the Scriptures ſo furniſhed and prepared, and he ſhall find them cleare and eaſie to be vnderſtood, in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie points of faith, as experience giueth witneſſe, and euerie true Chriſtian can teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if the Scriptures bee obſcure, then much more the writings of men; and if Scriptures bee hard to be vnderſtood, then much more mens writings. For man, when he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, is not at hand to inſtruct his Reader, but is either abſent far off, or perhaps dead; ſo that hee cannot enforme the Reader of his mind: but God is euer the liuing God, and both can and doth enforme by his holy Spirit, ſuch as in reading his bookes doe reade deuoutly, and beg of God humbly his gracious dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Mans knowledge is but in part, he cannot certainely foreſee all his Readers, what they ſhall be, how they will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him: but Gods knowledge is as himſelfe, infinite, and he foreknoweth all that ſhall reade his booke, and thereafter fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his Word, as is beſt for their profit.</p>
                  <p>To conclude therefore, let our Aduerſaries impute to the Scriptures what they will, let them (if they will be ſtill ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly blaſphemous) call them a dumb Iudge, inkie diuinitie, a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den rule, &amp; what elſe, the very ſame and more alſo may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of mens writings, vpon the forenamed reaſons; what way ſoeuer they doe weaken the credit of the Scriptures, by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame doe they much more take away credit from mens writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And therefore let them lay all writings aſide, <hi>Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and Decretals, Canons of Councels, the writings of Fathers, of Schoolemen, of Doctors, of Prieſts and Ieſuites,</hi> and other pettie Writers, <hi>Pamphlets</hi> whatſoeuer, if the Scriptures be neglected.</p>
                  <p>Act. 8. 30. Philip <hi>ſaid, Vnderſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt? And he ſaid, How can I, except ſome man ſhould guide me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is a Lay-man well exerciſed, and had his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without diſpenſation for money, to reade the Scriptures, verſ. 28. which was neuer denyed to any of the Iewiſh, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, till the times of this Romiſh Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>2. This place is ſpoken of a Proſelyte, a Noucie in Religion, one that dwelt not amongſt Gods people, to heare the Law and Prophets daily read and expounded, as they were in Iudea, Act.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1814:25"/> 15. 21. and 13. 15. Will it follow therefore, that what was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure to him, was, and is yet obſcure to others, liuing in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Church? It will perhaps follow among Papiſts, who haue Scriptures read in an vnknowne tongue, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to haue them tranſlated, and freely to be read of all, but not elſe-where.</p>
                  <p>3. This is but one place, and that Propheticall too. What will they hence conclude? One place, &amp; that Propheticall, was not vnderſtood of one man, a young beginner, and that at the firſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> all the holy Scriptures are obſcure to all the people, and that for euer? In Romiſh Diuinity, a goodly concluſion.</p>
                  <p>4. He vnderſtood it after by <hi>Philips</hi> guiding, and beleeued in Chriſt, verſ. 36. 37. We acknowledge the people to need a guide; but let them reade freely, as the Eunuch here, and where they doubt, let them aske their Teachers, or let Teachers, like <hi>Philip,</hi> goe to them, and direct them in reading; but take not Bibles from them, and burne both them and it, as furious Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands haue done, without all example of any good men from the worlds beginning.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 24. 25, 27. <hi>O Fooles and ſlow of heart, &amp;c. Beginning at</hi> Moſes <hi>and all the Prophets, he expounded vnto them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt reproueth not ſimply their ignorance of Scripture, but rather their ſlowneſſe of heart to beleeue and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all that the Prophets had ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>2. Expounding argueth not obſcuritie in the Scriptures, but want of vnderſtanding in the men, and yet not that altogether, but in ſome degree or meaſure.</p>
                  <p>3. The things were not euery thing in the Scripture, but that which concerned Chriſt himſelfe, touching his ſuffering and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againe to glory, which being then vnperformed and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were the more obſcure, euen to the Diſciples themſelues before their illumination. Chriſts words therefore are proper to thoſe perſons, and to that time, till he had better informed them, and not to be applyed to this time, when all thoſe things are plainely taught vs by the publication of the Goſpell, and doctrine of thoſe Apoſtles and Diſciples, who therefore recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1814:26"/> miraculous illuminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſpirit, that they might preach and write clearely to vs, euen to all people, of thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>Reuel. 5. 4. <hi>And he (to wit,</hi> Iohn) <hi>wept much, becauſe no man was in Heauen or in Earth found worthy to open the booke, and to reade the booke neither to looke thereon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This may bee meant metaphorically of ſome other booke of Gods Counſels and Decrees; and if of the Bible, yet not of the whole Bible, but of the booke of the Reuelation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Papiſts will haue <hi>Iohn</hi> at this time one that neuer had been worthy to open, or to reade, or to looke into Gods Word. What, none, neither in Heauen nor earth? Neuer a Prophet? Neuer an Apoſtle, to haue hitherto opened the Bible? How then was <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets read vnto the people, before <hi>Iohn</hi> was in Pathmos?</p>
                  <p>2. This ſpeakes not of the obſcuritie of the booke, but of the vnworthineſſe of any, ſaue Ieſus Chriſt, to vnlooſe the ſeales, and to open it, verſ. 9.</p>
                  <p>3. This is but of one booke, and that, before it was vnſealed and opened; will it therefore follow, that all the reſt of the books are hard to be vnderſtood, being all open, and none pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by God to reade them?</p>
                  <p>2. Pet. 1. 20. <hi>No prophecie of Scripture is made by priuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Who wil deny this, or which of vs holdeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary?</p>
                  <p>2. Here is nothing for the Scriptures obſcurity, but rather this proueth their plainenes: for it ſpeakes of their interpretation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting holy mens ſpeaking in the Scriptures, as they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the holy Ghoſt, to be an interpretation, and that not a priuate, but a publike interpretation, not made of their owne wil, or of mans wil, but of the will of God, as his Spirit led them.</p>
                  <p>Mat. 13. 11, 36. <hi>To you is giuen to know the myſteries, &amp;c. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to vs the Parable, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This place may bee brought as well againſt the Word vnwritten, as written: for Chriſt wrote not, but ſpake the Parable, which they deſired to haue expounded; what will become then of their vnwritten word, if that be obſcure too? Hee that alleaged this againſt the plaineneſſe of the written
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1814:26"/> Word, much forgot himſelfe, and his vnwritten word.</p>
                  <p>2. Vnderſtanding this of the written Word, nothing can be more againſt themſelues: for here it is ſaid, that it is the gift gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Church to vnderſtand the Myſteries of the kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p>3. They deſired Chriſt to expound the parable. What then? <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Scripture is obſcure? A groſſe concluſion: for it was Chriſts not written, but as then his vnwritten Word, and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable which they vnderſtood not, but he plainely expounded it afterwards, verſ. 37. 43. and now it is written. So that, what at firſt was not vnderſtood, was after explained, vnderſtood, and the ſame alſo written; And therefore the Scripture is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure by this Parable, but rather the more cleare, becauſe it is written, and the interpretation thereof alſo.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 24. 45. <hi>Then he opened their vnderſtandings, that they might vnderſtand the Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This place is to be vnderſtood of ſuch things as concerned the Meſſiah, touching Chriſt his ſuffering, as afore in verſ. 25. 26.</p>
                  <p>2. This is nothing to the obſcurity of the Scripture: for the Scripture was cleare, but their vnderſtanding was not, till hee opened it, and what they then vnderſtood not, now euery ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Chriſtian doth know, and can finde it laid downe plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, by the Apoſtles themſelues. Therefore if their ignorance at that time of thoſe things may conclude obſcurity of Scripture, then the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne of them, and taught fully to vs in Scripture, may make for the Scriptures cleareneſſe.</p>
                  <p>3. We acknowledge, that all need to haue their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings opened by Chriſt, to read the Scriptures; becauſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man perceiues not the things of God, but are ſpiritually diſcerned, 1. Cor. 2. 14. But is the Sunne darke, becauſe God doth make a blind man to ſee it? Yet thus our aduerſaries rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, The Scriptures are obſcure, becauſe God opens mens vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to ſee the things therein deliuered.</p>
                  <p>1. Cor. 12. 20. <hi>To another, diſcerning of ſpirits; to another, kind of tongues; to another, interpretation of Languages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1814:27"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is not a word of the obſcurity of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but of extraordinary gifts then by Gods Spirit beſtowed vpon ſome, for the Churches good, to make the Scriptures ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 8. 10. <hi>To you it is giuen to know, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The anſwere to this is, as to the place in Mat. 10. 11. but they alleadge moreouer, Luk. 18. 34. <hi>And they vnderſtood none of theſe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This place is not againſt the Word written: For all thoſe things then not vnderſtood, they after vnderſtood, and wrote them, and wee plainely doe vnderſtand them in Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>2. This place ſpeaketh of the Word deliuered by Chriſts mouth: I hope they will not haue that Word obſcute too: what will then become of the Traditionall word, which they ſo prattle of? But the Gagger heapes vp any thing to make a ſhew, though he ſpeake at vnawares againſt themſelues.</p>
                  <p>3. Still here is of things, and not of the Scriptures; and of onely ſome things; but not of all. They cannot therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the generall, that the Scriptures are obſcure.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 2. 50. <hi>And they vnderſtood not the Word hee ſpake vnto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The fault is laid vpon their vnderſtanding.</p>
                  <p>2. It is not of the Scripture but of a word then not written.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> vnderſtood not then that Word. <hi>Ergo,</hi> none now? Is it not now written? and doe not euery one now know, that he ſpake of his heauenly Fathers buſineſſe? Belike, if the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> were now vpon the earth, the papiſts would not allow her to reade the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>2. Tim 3. 7. <hi>Alwaies learning, and neuer attaining to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no Scripture mentioned.</p>
                  <p>2. If they will haue this to be of their learning the Scriptures, then this ſheweth that women in thoſe dayes, meddled with Scriptures, which the Papiſts now cannot abide to heare of.</p>
                  <p>3. The fault is not laid vpon the truth; but vpon thoſe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners negligence or dulneſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1814:27"/>
                  <p>4. Conſider what learners they were. Firſt, ſilly women: Secondly, loaden with ſinnes. Thirdly, led with diuers luſts. Fourthly, led captiue by falſe Teachers, verſe 6. It is no maruell that theſe could not come to the knowledge of the truth: and becauſe ſuch could not attaine to it, therefore is it hard to be attained to of all others? This is an excellent Scripture, to ſhew why the collapſing women, and ſuch Apoſtates as fall from vs now to them, cannot attaine to the knowledge of the truth; becauſe indeede, they are laden with ſinnes, led with diuers luſts, and by falſe Teachers led captiue to their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe here they neuer had a true loue to the Truth.</p>
                  <p>1. Ioh. 4. 6. <hi>Hee that knoweth God, heareth vs: he that is not of God, heareth vs not: in this we know the Spirit of Truth and the ſpirit of errour.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What they can conclude hence touching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſee not: The Spirit of Truth in man, which teacheth him to know God, teacheth him alſo to heare thoſe which are ſent of God: and likewiſe, where the ſpirit of error is, and ſuch as are not of God, cannot liſten and giue eare to ſuch as are of God: for the ſpirit of errour oppoſeth the true Teachers; as Papiſts doe vs.</p>
                  <p>Pſal. 119. 18, 34. <hi>Open thou mine eyes, &amp;c. and giue me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee teach, that to come to knowledge, all muſt pray to God to inſtruct them, euen the beſt learned.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Dauid,</hi> that now prayed, had a great deale of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as he confeſſeth in verſ. 11. 54, 97, 98, 99, 100, 104, 105. therefore here he prayeth to be more and more acquainted with heauenly knowledge, deſiring the increaſe thereof: for the godlieſt haue not al knowledge at once. It is not the word of Scripture, that <hi>Dauid</hi> deſires vnderſtanding in, nor to haue his eyes open to ſee what the Words of Gods Lawes were; but he would ſee the <hi>wonderous things</hi> thereof.

                  <head>Obiected Scriptures anſwered.</head>
                  <p>Deut. 10. 5. <hi>The two Tables were written by God, and put by</hi> Moſes <hi>into the Arke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What then? Therefore the Scriptures are not to bee common and freely read of all? If the putting of the Tables in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Arke might force ſuch a concluſion, the Scriptures might not onely bee kept from the people, but from the Clergie too: for thoſe put into the Arke, were neither for Prieſt nor people to reade. But I anſwere more particularly:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That theſe were not all the Scriptures of God, although all that God himſelf did immediately write with his owne fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe commandements in the Tables were alſo written out by <hi>Moſes</hi> in Exod. 20. and in Deut. 5. which Bookes after were alſo copied out, and ſo were in the hands of the Prieſts, Princes and people.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The putting them into the Arke, was not that thence man ſhould learne not to meddle with holy Scriptures, which none euer dreamed of, but theſe Romiſts. For God commanded to teach them to his people, Deut. 6. 1. and they were to inſtruct their children therein, Deut. 6. 7. but they were put into the Arke for other ends:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To keepe them ſafe there, as a teſtimony againſt Iſrael.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To learne to keepe them in their heart, as they were kept in the Arke.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe the Arke was a type of Chriſt, in whom this Law of commandements was written, and in whom the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be accounted obſeruers of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Deut. 31. 9, 26. <hi>There was but one copie of the Law, and it was committed to the Prieſts of the Leuites to keepe, and was hid for a long time, till it was found in</hi> Ioſias <hi>dayes,</hi> 2. King. 22. 8.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Scriptures were not common to all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its true, that there was but one originall that was kept: but other copies were commanded to bee written out, Deut. 17. 18. and the ſame to be read diligently, verſ. 19. <hi>Ioſhua</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:1814:32"/> had a copie of it, Ioſh. 8. 34. <hi>Eſdras</hi> had ſo, Neh. 8. 2. In <hi>Iehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phats</hi>

Chron. 17. 9. <hi>Daniel</hi> had bookes, Dan. 9. 2. Chriſt telleth vs in the Parable, Luk. 15. 29. that they had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. The Law and Prophets were read in their Synagogues from old time, Act. 13. 15. and 15. 21. How alſo could the Bereans ſearch the Scriptures, if they had not had them? Act. 17. 11. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that to the Iewes were committed the Oracles of God, Rom. 3. 2. The booke of the Law was written, to be read and heard of the people, Deut. 31. 11, 12. So were alſo the Prophets writings, Ier. 36. 6, 10, 14, 15. and free for any to reade them, that could get copies of them, as wee may ſee in the Eunuch, Act. 8. 28. By all which it is cleare, that the Scriptures were common for all.</p>
                  <p>Nehem. 8. Here they would gather, that the Scriptures were read in Hebrew, and yet the people vnderſtood not the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: ſo by certaine words in the Euangeliſts, not Hebrew, which were then ſpoken of the people, as <hi>Golgotha,</hi> Mat. 27. 33. <hi>Talitha cumi,</hi> Mark 5. 41. <hi>Acheldama,</hi> in Act. 1. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Scriptures of the old Teſtament were in the Hebrew tongue, is true: but that the people vnderſtood not that tongue, is as falſe as the other true: for its ſaid, as their own Bible hath it, Neh. 8. 3. that <hi>Eſdras</hi> read plainely in the preſence of the men and women, and of thoſe that <hi>vnderſtood,</hi> and the eares of <hi>all</hi> the people were attent to the <hi>Booke,</hi> verſ. 8. and they <hi>vnderſtood when it was read.</hi> And though they were 70. yeeres in Captiuitie, yet had they not loſt the knowledge of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew tongue: for many thouſands, and not a few, of note and place, which went into captiuitie, liued to returne againe, Eſdras 2. 1, 2, 3, 42, 65. and 3. 12. And ſhall we thinke, that theſe had loſt their natiue tongue? After their returne, they had ſome ſtrange words mixed with the Hebrew; but yet they generally ſpake the Iewes language, Neh. 13. 24. and the Prophets <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai, Zacharie,</hi> and <hi>Malachi,</hi> wrote in the Hebrew: and the people hundreds of yeres after vnderſtood the Hebrew tongue when it was ſpoken, Act. 21. 40. and 22. 2. and could reade it written, Ioh. 19. 20. yea, it was ſo common, that Chriſt ſpake He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1814:33"/> and in no other Language to <hi>Paul</hi> from Heauen, Act. 26. 14. And as for the words of Chriſt on the Croſſe, Matth. 27. 46. which ſome hearing, ſaid, He calleth for <hi>Eliah:</hi> if they were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Iewes, they did it in mockage. If of the Romane ſouldiers, they being ſtrangers, and not vnderſtanding him, it maketh nothing to the purpoſe, or point in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Ioh. 7. 49. <hi>The people which knoweth not the Law, are curſed.</hi> Hence they would gather, that the Iewes vnderſtood not the Hebrew language, in which the Law was written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Phariſes arrogated knowledge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and contemned the people for want of knowledge, to wit, of the ſenſe and meaning of the Law, but not of the letters, words and language, wherein it was written.</p>

                  <p>2. That the teſtimony of the Scriptures are of more credit then the teſtimony of men; for the witneſſe of God is greater then men, 1. Ioh. 5. 9. And Chriſt preferred the teſtimony of the Scriptures before mans teſtimony, yea, though a Prophet: for he ſaith, he receiued not teſtimony of man, ſpeaking of <hi>Iohn Bapt.</hi> Ioh. 5. 33, 34. and yet he referred himſelf to the teſtimony of the Scriptures, teſtifying of him, verſ. 39.

So that the Scriptures teſtimony of themſelues, being the Word of God, &amp; ſo the teſtimony of God, are ſufficient witnes to take them for the Scriptures of God; which whoſo refuſeth or queſtioneth, the teſtimony of no men, no, not of Chriſt, if he

All the Prophets witneſſe their Prophecies to be of God, Eſay 1, 2. Ier. 1. 2. Ezech. 1. 3. Dan. 10. 1. Hoſ. 1. 1. Ioel 1. 1. Amos 1. 3. Obadiah 1. 1. Ionah 1. 1. Mich. 1. 1. Nah. 1. 1. Hab. 1. 1.

And ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Act. 26. 22. Rom. 16. 23. not onely in expounding, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by alleaging one where or other ſome thing out of euery booke; as out of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> Mat. 23. 35. Act. 7. 3. and 3. 25.

Act. 13. 21, 22. Rom. 11. 3. Heb. 11. 32. <hi>Iob,</hi> Iam. 5. 11. <hi>Pſalmes</hi> the whole book, Act. 1. 16, 20. and parts thereof, Mat. 13. 35. and 21. 16, 42. <hi>Prouerbs,</hi> Rom. 12. 26.

So might I goe thorow all the ſmall Prophets, but that whole booke of the Prophets is approoued, Act. 7. 42. And all the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, are called by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the words of God, Rom. 3. 2. and are confirmed in particular, as the reſt: as <hi>Hoſea,</hi> Mat. 9. 13. and 12. 7. Ro. 9. 25, 26. <hi>Ioel,</hi> Act. 2. 16. <hi>Ionas,</hi> Mat. 12. 40. <hi>Amos,</hi> Act. 7. 43. <hi>Micha,</hi> Mat. 2. 6. <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> Mat. 27. 9. <hi>Habacuk,</hi> Rom. 1. 17.

                  <p>Thus the old Teſtament beareth witneſſe to it ſelfe, and the New alſo to the Old; ſo doth the Old to the New, foreſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1814:36"/> what in the New is reuealed, beſides the record it beareth of it ſelfe: For <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs, that his writings are the truth of God, Ioh. 19. 35. Reuel. 1. 1. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that his are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, 1. Cor. 14. 37. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> confirmeth the authoritie of all <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, 2. Pet. 3. 16. And thus muſt we thinke of all the Apoſtles writings, as the diuine truth of God, becauſe they were all led by the ſame Spirit, Ioh. 15. 26. into all truth, Ioh. 16. 13. which called the words of Chriſt to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, Ioh. 14. 26. which Spirit Chriſt gaue them, and they had receiued, Ioh. 17. 8. Neither is it to be doubted, but as their words in their Miniſterie were the words of God, Mat. 10. 20. Mark. 13. 11. ſo were their words written of God alſo, ſeeing they wrote what they taught, as theſe places ſhew, Luk. 1. 1, 3, 4. Act. 1. 1. 1. Cor. 15. 1. 2. Cor. 1. 13. Phil. 3. 1. 2. Theſ. 2. 5. and as before is prooued at large.</p>
                  <p>V. Their owne Bible telleth vs, that the Word is a lampe and a light, Pſal. 118. 105. 2. Pet. 1. 19. This is ſpoken of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<note place="margin">

Now a lampe and a light need no man to point to them, that hath eyes to ſee, if the ſame be before them, but they ſhew themſelues to ſuch clearely enough; euen ſo doth the light of Gods Word in Scripture ſhew it ſelfe. Gods workes ſhew themſelues to be his workes out of themſelues, Act. 14. 16. He leſt not himſelfe without teſtimony, Rom. 1. 20. Pſal. 18. 1. His<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> workes ſhew him, and ſhew themſelues to be his; and ſhall not Gods Word ſhew it ſelfe to be Gods Word? Is there to a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man a leſſe print of the Deitie in his Word to diſcerne it, then in a very naturall man to diſcerne his workes? Moreouer, ſhall the writings of men diſcouer their Authors, of what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and learning they be and ſhall not Gods Word be able to ſhew it ſelfe to bee of God? For let one man write like an Artiſt; another, as a Philoſopher; the third, as a Moraliſt; the fourth, as a Statiſt; the fifth, as a Diuine: No man that is an Artiſt, a Philoſopher, a Moraliſt, a Statiſt or Diuine, but hee can diſcerne of all theſe writings diſtinctly, though hee haue not ſome to tell him, what they bee. So let a man, endued with Gods Spirit, and ſpirituall vnderſtanding, come to the holy Scriptures, he will diſcerne them to be of God, and of his Spirits
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1814:36"/> inditing, though none beare witneſſe to them, and tell him ſo much. For the ſpirituall man iudgeth all things, 1.

The worke of an <hi>Apelles</hi> is eaſily diſcerned from that, which is an ordinarie Painters. And wee know, that men well read, are ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted, as that they can diſcerne learned mens writings from the counterfeites of them. How much more then may the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of God, ſo infinitely ſurmounting all others in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of grace, dexteritie and maieſtie of themſelues, be ſeuered and ſundred from all other writings, and be knowne to be of the Lords owne inditing?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as in generall the Scriptures ſhew themſelues to bee Gods Word, and alſo more particularly, that the ſeuerall books thereof are his Word: So theſe very bookes, which wee at this day acknowledge, and haue in account for Gods Word, and ſo beleeue them to be, doe witneſſe for themſelues, that they are indeed the very Word of God, though the Church ſhould bee ſilent in her dutie ſo to profeſſe, and teach them to be.

                  <p>The Church is to teſtifie of them, to interpret them out of themſelues, to keepe them, and to defend them; but ſhe cannot either make them to be Gods word, if they were not ſo already: for ſhe cannot make a word to be mans, if man neuer ſpoke it; neither can ſhe make Gods word to be his word vnto vs vpon her owne credit, if it ſelfe bare not witneſſe of it ſelfe, and the

                  <p>2. Theſ. 2. 15. <hi>Stand faſt, and hold the traditions which ye haue beene taught, whether by word, or by our Epiſtle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This place, though in ſhew, at the firſt ſight may ſeeme to helpe them; yet conſidering well what they in the Queſtion vnderſtand by traditions, it helpes them nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>1. Traditions here are ſuch, as all the Theſſalonians recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and which the Apoſtles had taught to them all: but tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which the Papiſts maintain, are certaine ſecret traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deliuered, not to all, but to ſome ſorts of men, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter guiding of the Church. Therefore theſe traditions here, are not thoſe, theſe being common to all, and theirs proper to ſome onely.</p>
                  <p>2. This place ſpeakes of Traditions written, which wee maintaine: but they in this queſtion vnderſtand traditions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Scripture, or a word not written in the Scriptures: how then doth this place helpe them?</p>
                  <p>3 This place doth ſpeake indeed of traditions deliuered by word and by writing, but not of diuers traditions; as one ſort ſpoken, and another ſort written: but of a diuers way of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the very ſame traditions: for firſt, traditions are but once here named, and applied to both <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> Secondly,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1814:40"/> the word <hi>Whether</hi> may bee as wel taken <hi>coniunctiuely,</hi> as it is in 1. Cor. 15. 11. &amp; 13. 8. Rom. 14. 8. Col. 1. 20. as <hi>diſiunctiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> and albeit here it be taken <hi>diſiunctiuely,</hi> yet it proueth not diuerſitie of traditions, but the ſame diuerſly deliuered.</p>
                  <p>5. By this place it is cleare, that traditions were firſt by word: but will it therefore follow that they were not written? The contrary is to bee ſhewed from the beginning. 1. Before the Law the Word was not written, but as before is proued, it was afterwards written. 2. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets deliuered Gods wil, firſt by word of mouth, but afterwards the ſame was written. Thirdly, Chriſt taught by word, which afterwards the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giliſts wrote, Luk, 1. 2, 3. Fourthly, the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taught by word as other did, but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth vs, that he was ſet apart to teach <hi>the Goſpell,</hi> Rom. 1. 1. which he calleth the <hi>Word of God,</hi> 1. Theſ. 2. 2, 13. This Word of the Lord Ieſus he onely taught euery where, and by him it was ſpred abroad, Act. 18. 11. &amp; 19. 10. to which he commended the Church, Act. 20. 32. This Word and Goſpell ſpred ſo farre by him, Rom. 15. 19. hee telleth vs, was written before in the holy Scriptures, Rom. 1. 2. ſo that he taught not an vnwritten, but a written Word, and a written Goſpell, Act. 26. 22. and 28. 23. Rom. 16. 26.</p>
                  <p>5. The traditions here mentioned, firſt taught by word, are written traditions, which he calleth in 1. Theſ. 4. 2. Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; but theſe Comandements giuen by word of mouth before, after in writing to them, hee here ſetteth downe verſ. 3. 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12. yea, what letteth to vnderſtand theſe tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by word to bee thoſe things, which in the 5. verſe of this chapter, he ſaith, He remembreth them of, ſet downe in verſ. 3. 4? If ſo, then are theſe traditions written, and not now vnwritten, though at the firſt taught by word.</p>
                  <p>6. Though it were granted, that the traditions taught by word, were not all written by the Apoſtle then, in neither of theſe Epiſtles; I demand firſt, how can they be able hence to proue, that neither he elſewhere, nor any other Apoſtle wrote them, but that they remaine to this day vnwritten? Secondly, how can they tell what theſe were, if they be not written?
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1814:40"/> Thirdly, how are they able to proue, that theſe traditions not written and taught by the Apoſtle, are their Popiſh traditions, which they ſtand for? Three neceſſarie queſtions vnreſolued hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.</p>
                  <p>7. And laſtly, If they thus will reaſon, that there is yet an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written word to be a rule, becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught traditions firſt by word; then is there much more a written word to be a rule, for that thoſe ſpoken, were after written: for that which is ſpoken and written, is with all men more certaine and ſure then that which onely is ſpoken. Now, of one and the ſame thing to be ruled, there cannot be two rules, as before is proued. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs cleaue to the Word written, as the moſt certaine and ſureſt rule, becauſe it is both the word ſpoken and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                  <p>2. Theſ. 3. 6. <hi>And not according to the tradition which they haue receiued of vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is mention of a tradition, which the Apoſtle had taught, and the Theſſalonians had receiued; but this is not an vnwritten tradition, but written: for the Apoſtle in verſ. 10. ſets it downe, and telles vs plainely what it was, to wit, <hi>That if any would not worke, let him not eate.</hi> So as this is nothing for their vnwritten traditions.</p>
                  <p>1. Cor. 11. 2. <hi>And I pray you, brethren, &amp;c. that you keepe the precepts as I deliuered them vnto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Wee grant, that the Apoſtle deliuered and taught by word of mouth, before he wrote: but the queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame he taught, be writ, or no? They ſay, they be not: which this place proueth not, neither can they bring any place either expreſſely, or by neceſſarie concluſion. To this purpoſe, we ſay they be, and doe proue it by many Scriptures afore ſet downe, as alſo in anſwere to the firſt place, of which nature is this Scripture: for the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>I deliuered them vnto you:</hi> and in verſ. 23. hee hath the very ſame words, and withall ſetteth downe, what he deliuered to them, in verſ. 23, 24 25. So that what he deliuered by word, is now in his writings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this place, according to their tranſlation, is of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> they here auoyde the word traditions: if it be not for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1814:41"/> why doe they alleage it? And if it be for traditions, why doe they not name the Word here; as elſewhere in other places? But let them bee <hi>precepts:</hi> what then? If precepts of neceſſarie and ſubſtantial matters of the Goſpell, then were the ſame writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: for <hi>Paul</hi> preached them onely out of the Scriptures, Act. 26. 22. and 28. 23. according to the Scriptures, 1. Cor. 1 5 3, 4. For, as is proued, his Goſpell was a written Goſpell, and what hee preached, the ſame ſubſtantiall points himſelfe did afterwards write, as appeareth in the ſame Epiſtle, chap. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. And<note place="margin">Eadem ſcrifiere, hoc e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Being then written precepts, here is no proofe for their vnwritten tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. If they vnderſtand them of precepts, in and about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of indifferencie, rites, and decences in the Church, &amp;c. the place is nothing to the queſtion in hand; and yet precepts in ſuch matters are alſo written, 1. Cor. 6. 12. and 8. 9, 13. and 10. 23, 31, 32. and therefore taken which way they pleaſe, they are now written, and not vnwritten precepts.</p>
                  <p>1. Tim. 6. 20. O <hi>Timothy,</hi> keepe the <hi>depoſitum</hi> (that is, ſay the Rhemiſts) the whole doctrine of our Chriſtianitie, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like truth deſcending from the Apoſtles by ſucceſſion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops euen vnto the end, &amp; is all one with tradition (ſay they, in their annotation) giuen to the Biſhops to keep, and not to Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The Gagger alleageth the third verſe alſo, and ſo, as it ſeemeth, doth take the word <hi>doctrine,</hi> as here the word <hi>depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> that is, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> expounds it, the treaſure of vnwritten doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no mention of tradition, neither doth this place proue, that this <hi>depoſitum</hi> is now an vnwritten doctrine.</p>
                  <p>2. Hee ſpeakes of a <hi>depoſitum</hi> committed to <hi>Timothy</hi> his truſt: but whether written, or onely ſpoken, is not ſet downe here, and ſo proueth not the point in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>3. Of themſelues there be that expound this <hi>depoſitum</hi> farre otherwiſe. <hi>Caietan</hi> expounds it of the flocke committed to him So alſo <hi>Lyra:</hi> their Gloſſe takes it to be his office. So <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Cardinalis: Aquinas</hi> interpreteth it of euery good thing, which any man hath committed to him of God to keepe, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Thus they agree not among themſelues: if they cannot
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1814:41"/> agree about the ſenſe of the word; is this then a ſound proofe of ſo great a point as is in queſtion? Muſt a Rule to rule holy Scripture, and the holy Church, be grounded vpon ſuch an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine meaning?</p>
                  <p>4. But let the Rhemiſts interpretation of the word goe for ſound; it is enough to ouerthrow their tenent: for this <hi>depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> they make the <hi>whole doctrine of our Chriſtianitie.</hi> If this be the <hi>Treaſure of vnwritten doctrine,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will haue it, what doth the Scripture containe? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth vs, 1. Tim. 1. 11. that the <hi>glorious Goſpell was committed to his truſt,</hi> as this <hi>depoſitum was committed to</hi> Timothy <hi>his truſt;</hi> if theſe two bee one, as they are: for was another thing committed to the truſt of <hi>Timothy,</hi> then was committed to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> truſt? Then the Goſpell is the whole doctrine of our Chriſtianity, except there be doctrines of Chriſtianity which are not Goſpell: but the Goſpell is written, as before is prooued, and therefore alſo is this a written <hi>depoſitum,</hi> and not an vnwritten doctrine.</p>
                  <p>5. This place wicked heretickes ſo expounded; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend<note place="margin">Tertul. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. aduerſus Haeret. ca. 25.</note> their hereticall falſities, feigned ſuch a ſenſe of this place, of certaine vnwritten traditions, as the Papiſts doe; by which they may ſee whence they be.</p>
                  <p>2. Tim. 1. 13. <hi>Haue thou a forme of ſound words, which thou haſt heard of me:</hi> the ſame is mentioned, Rom. 6. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This ſheweth, that a forme of words were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by mouth; but hence will it not follow, that the ſame is not now written. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructed by word of mouth; <hi>Ergo,</hi> may it be concluded, that he wrote not the ſame? How in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will this follow? And yet this is the thing to be proued, or elſe nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>2. The place ſheweth in what things this forme of words is to bee kept, to wit, <hi>in faith and in loue;</hi> but the forme of the words of our beliefe is in the Scripture, Ioh. 20. 31. Act. 8. 37. and alſo of our loue, Mat. 22. 37, 39.</p>
                  <p>3. If by forme of words they will vnderſtand the <hi>compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> of Chriſtianitie concerning Faith, Obedience, Prayer, and forme of adminiſtring the holy Sacraments; all theſe be alſo in the Scriptures, as <hi>our Creed, the ten Commandements, the Lords
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1814:42"/> Prayer,</hi> as before is ſhewed. <hi>For baptiſme,</hi> reade Mat. 28. 19. and <hi>for the Lords Supper,</hi> Mat. 26. 26, 27, 28. 1. Cor. 11. 23, 24 25. Therefore here is no forme of words left vnwritten, as out of this place the Papiſts pretend.</p>
                  <p>2. Tim. 2. 2. <hi>And the things which thou haſt heard, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This ſtill ſpeakes of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, but proueth not the ſame not to be written.</p>
                  <p>2. It hath been before proued, that <hi>Paul</hi> preached openly the Scriptures, and therfore by the things heard from him, muſt be meant thoſe which he taught out of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>3. It is probable, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe preaching out of the Scriptures, and onely according to the Scriptures, alſo highly commending Scriptures to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to be able to make perfect the man of God to euery good worke, 2. Tim. 3. 16, 17. that hee would haue any thing commended by <hi>Timothy</hi> to other Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but what was to be found in holy Scriptures?</p>
                  <p>This place therefore helpes not for vnwritten traditions.</p>
                  <p>Ioh. 20. 30. <hi>Many other ſignes did Ieſus, &amp;c. which are not written in this booke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Euangeliſt ſaith, they were not written in this booke. But what then? May they not be written in other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts?</p>
                  <p>2. Here he ſpeakes of ſignes, and Acts of Chriſt, and not of his doctrine by tradition, which is the matter in queſtion: and ſo this text is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Ioh. 21. 25. <hi>There are many other things which alſo Ieſus did, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This place alſo ſpeaketh of that which Ieſus did, and not of that which he taught. Here is not one ſyllable of a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionarie word.</p>
                  <p>Ioh. 16 12. <hi>Many things I haue to ſay to you, but you cannot beare them now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This place tels vs not what Chriſt ſaid, but what hee concealed, to wit, many things which he had to ſpeake, but then ſpake not: ſo as this proueth not a traditionall word, nor any word at all, except they will conclude, that what one can ſay, therefore he doth ſay it.</p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:1814:42"/>
                  <p>2. If Chriſt had ſaid all things to the Apoſtles then, yet would it not follow, that the ſame were not at all written in Scripture: for Ieſus Chriſt taught, what was written in the Scriptures, expounded them, cited them, and by them confuted the Aduerſaries. And Saint <hi>Luke</hi> makes a profeſſion, that his Goſpell was <hi>A Treatiſe of all that Ieſus began both to doe and ſpeake,</hi> vnto the day of his Aſcenſion, Act. 1. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>3. Can our Aduerſaries tell what things Chriſt had to ſay? If they can; firſt, let them ſhew to vs what they were: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were differing from thoſe things taught by him, and written now in the new Teſtament: thirdly, that they were neuer written by the Apoſtles. If theſe they cannot demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to vs, they gaine nothing hence for their pretended tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary<note place="margin">Auguſt. 77. tract. in Iohn.</note> word. This place heretickes abuſed for their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This ſpeaketh not affirmatiuely of a cuſtome, but negatiuely of no ſuch cuſtome.</p>
                  <p>2. Though it had ſpoken of a cuſtome, what is this to a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall word? Is cuſtome, doctrine? Or is it not rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to actions, as in Gen. 31. 35. Ioh. 18. 39?</p>
                  <p>3. The Scriptures allow not cuſtome to be a Rule, Leu. 18. 2.<note place="margin">See Doway Tranſlation.</note> Ier. 10. 2. 2 King. 17. 40.</p>

But can our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries proue; firſt, that <hi>Iohn</hi> euer came to vtter the things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written? If he did, what were they? If he did not, then ſo much of their conceited traditionall word is loſt. Secondly, that thoſe moe things left vnwritten, were either things neceſſarie, or they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1814:43"/> were not things already written. Til they can ſhew theſe things, this place doth them no good.</p>

                  <p>Now let vs ſee, what theſe keyes be, by which hee openeth and ſhutteth, byndeth and looſeth, forgiueth and retaineth ſins. Theſe <hi>Keyes</hi> are theſe two, <hi>Chriſts Word</hi> and <hi>Chriſts Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat 18. 18. Ioh. 20. 23.</note> which I thus proue:</p>
                  <p>1. For that in this Text is a promiſe of giuing the keyes, <hi>I will giue the keyes, &amp;c.</hi> Now, ſeeing that here they are not giuen, but promiſed, let vs ſee, what Chriſt gaue to <hi>Peter,</hi> and other the Apoſtles, and we ſhall finde, that he gaue them two things; his <hi>Word,</hi> which hee calleth the words of his Father, and the <hi>Word of reconciliation</hi> which he put in them, and they receiued, Ioh. 17. 8. 2. Cor. 5. 19. and <hi>his Spirit,</hi> Ioh. 20. 22. which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo receiued, when he ſaid, <hi>Receiue ye the holy Ghoſt,</hi> breathing on them. Theſe are the two things which we finde that he gaue
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1814:45"/> them: therefore they are either the keyes, or inſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of the keyes.</p>
                  <p>2. Chriſt, in Ioh. 20. 21. ſaith, <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo I alſo ſend you;</hi> ſo in Chap. 17. 18. But with theſe two did his Father ſend him; with <hi>his Word,</hi> Ioh. 7. 16. and 8. 26, 28, 38. and with <hi>his Spirit,</hi> Luk. 4. 18. Mat. 3. 16. Eſay 11. 2. and 42. 1. and 61. 1, 2. Therefore theſe two are the keyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Keyes</hi> are by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> interpretation, here taken for great authoritie and power, as in Eſay, 22. 22. in <hi>Eliakim,</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing the great power and authoritie in Chriſt, Reuel. 3. 7. exerciſed in his Church. But what greater power and authority then his Word and Spirit, can there be in Chriſt his Church? whatſoeuer it be, it is comprehended in theſe two. Therefore theſe be the keyes.</p>
                  <p>4. He ſpeakes of keyes, as of moe then one linked together; ſo that they are giuen as inſeparable: and ſo theſe two be: For the Spirit teacheth the Word of Chriſt, Ioh. 16. 13. and 14. 26. and the Word is with the Spirit, Eſay 59. 21. theſe two keyes are tyed together and giuen by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>5. The keyes promiſed here, are the keyes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen: In this ſpirituall Kingdome, by theſe to beare rule, by theſe to bind and looſe in earth; is ſo verily and as ſurely done in heauen. For what in this Kingdome here can beare Rule, but his Word, and his Spirit? What truly can bind and looſe in heauen, but theſe? We may be aſſured, that what the Word and Spirit of God bindeth, they are bound indeed, and what theſe looſe, remit, and forgiue, they are looſed, remitted, and forgiuen of God in heauen: of no other keyes can we be ſo aſſured hereof. Theſe then are the keyes here promiſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> and were giuen to all the Apoſtles, and to the true Church of God.</p>
                  <p>This place therefore helpeth nothing our Aduerſaries, who boaſt of an vnerring ſpirit, leading the Pope and his Prelates, into all truth: if they bragge of this key, let them ſhew vs the other, <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and the ſame written now in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; or elſe their boaſting is in vaine, and their binding and looſing of no force.</p>

               <p>WHen we ſpeake of an inuiſible Church, we meane the Church Catholicke in our Creede, which we doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and doe not ſee, nor can ſee: for faith is the ground and euidence of things not ſeene, Heb. 11. 1. alſo faith and ſight are oppoſed, 2. Cor. 5. 7. but wee onely beleeue the Catholicke Church, as in our Creed we confeſſe, and therefore is it inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, partly in heauen triumphing, partly here on earth mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, knowne onely to God, 2. Tim. 2. 19. and not diſcerned of men, becauſe they be only the Elect of God. This is the Church ſpoken of, Heb. 12. 22, 23, 24. Rom. 2. 28, 29. Mat. 16. 18. Eph. 1. 22. and 5. 23.

               <p>Beſides this Catholicke, we hold alſo a particular Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. For beginning in Paradiſe, we may finde ſuch a viſible Church till the flood; from thence to <hi>Moſes:</hi> from him (vnder whom it mightily increaſed into thouſands of families) till the ſame was planted in Canaan, where it became a Nationall Church, and neuer wanted ſome degree of viſibility in more or fewer of the members thereof, vnto the comming of Chriſt, who taught the people, and gathered Diſciples, which profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and after his Aſcenſion, were the firſt of thoſe, which after were called Chriſtians; all being then together in Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem for a time, and the only viſible Church of Chriſt vpon earth, which viſible Church through perſecution, began to be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad, and the Apoſtles and Teachers being alſo diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, this one Apoſtolicall Church ſpred farre and wide into the world, neuer being any more entire at once in one place, as before it had beene in Ieruſalem, but from that time to this day,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1814:48"/> hath beene, and is in ſeuerall Congregations, which are called Churches, euery one bearing the denomination of the whole, becauſe all of them doe make but one Church, as alſo for that euery one of them ſhould liuely repreſent that firſt Church in Ieruſalem, (from whence theſe other came into the world) in doctrine of the Apoſtles fellowſhip, Sacraments, and prayer with one accord, Act. 2. 42, 46.</p>
               <p>This Church taken in a generall notion, for all thoſe that profeſſe Chriſt any where, in any ſort, hath euer beene viſible in the world, &amp; alſo to the world, to Iewes, Turks and Pagans.</p>
               <p>But thus taken in ſo ſuperficiall, bare, and naked apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it comprehendeth all ſorts of Aſſemblies profeſſing Chriſt, whether purely or impurely, Orthodoxally, or Heretically, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formely, or Schiſmatically, and ſo hath ſeuerall names; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken from the City where ſuch Aſſemblies be, as the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem, Antioch, Corinth, Epheſus, Philippi, Theſſalonica,</hi> and <hi>Coloſſe;</hi> Sometime according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as the Churches of <hi>Galatia.</hi> So we ſay now, The Church of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland;</hi> Sometime from the Sect-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters names, as <hi>Arians, Macedonians, Eutychians, Neſtorians, Donatiſts,</hi> as now, <hi>Browniſts, Separatiſts, &amp;c.</hi> Sometime from the People, according to their Countrey where they were borne, though dwelling elſewhere, as wee haue here in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ſome other coaſts of England, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Churches; Sometime from the Coaſts, as the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Church;</hi> Sometime from the <hi>Language</hi> vſed in the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like worſhip,</hi> as the <hi>Greeke Church,</hi> and the <hi>Latine Church;</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the opinions held, as <hi>Anabaptiſts, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitaries,</hi> and <hi>Familists.</hi> And thus come we and our Aduerſaries to be diuerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly named: though we be all in generall called Chriſtians, yet wee call them that are yoaked vnder the B. of Rome, Papiſts, for their Pope and Romaniſts from their City; but they themſelues vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the name of <hi>Catholikes.</hi> They call vs <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts;</hi> but we make none ſaue only Chriſt the autor of our faith: commonly we are called <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> becauſe we continue our proteſtation againſt the enemies and abominations of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1814:48"/>
               <p>Such a Church thus taken in this generall manner, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt vnder one name or other, hath euer bene viſible, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the world. Thus we teach that the Church is euer viſible one where or other, and neuer wholy hidden at any time.</p>
               <p>But here in the queſtion, the name Church we take more ſtrictly, for a companie whereſoeuer aſſembled in publique, together worſhipping the true God in Ieſus Chriſt, as God himſelfe onely hath preſcribed by his Word, whereto outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they profeſſe conformitie, both for doctrine, and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo in good meaſure.</p>
               <p>This true Church of God, we ſay, is viſible; Firſt, in reſpect that it conſiſts of men, making open profeſſion. Secondly, in reſpect of the place being publique, where ſuch obtaine liberty to meete together. Thirdly, in reſpect of the externall actions in and about the worſhip of God; Thus this Church is viſible, but not alike gloriouſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpicuous at al times, in euery place where God planteth it; This Church we affirm not to be at any time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible: but we only ſay, it is ſometime hidden; neither yet do we meane hereby, that it is ſo hidden, as not to be found any where, of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſeeke after it by due means, as if it were vtterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: nor ſo hidden, as not to be ſeene of any, in any place: for ſuch a hiding we neuer dreame of, as our Aduerſaries inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret falſely againſt vs: but when we ſay it is hidden, we meane, that it is not acknowledged, but contemned by the euill ones, which loue not the truth, by reaſon of the fewnes of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 23. and 23 34.

For theſe reaſons, ſhe is ſaid to be hidden; and this hidden eſtate of the Church commeth to paſſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For that ſhe conſiſteth of a mixt companie, the worſer ſort ſometime, and for a long time comming to be the greater and a preuailing faction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As they preuaile, ſo they diminiſh the number, weaken the credit of thoſe profeſſing the truth, and do bring cunningly their owne will, their owne inuentions and wayes, into eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with the worldly minded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This preuailing faction and greater number increaſing,

               <p n="4">4. Hereupon they condemne the other as Schiſmatiques, and Hereticks, and their way as hereſie, and ſo raiſe vp againſt them perſecution, inhibiting their meetings in publique, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their Aſſemblies, puniſhing their Teachers, and making them to be generally euill ſpoken of, and putting by-names vpon them full of reproach, to cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the more deteſted of the worſt, and diſtaſted of indifferent minds, by forging ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lies and falſities vpon them, both in life and doctrine.</p>

               <p>THe Church here taken for the viſible Church, conſiſting of a mixt company, wee ſay, may erre. This their opinion taught and beleeued of the people, is the mother and nurſe of all the miſchiefes in that Romiſh Synagogue, which arrogateth the name and priuiledge of Gods Church, and that Church on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is intended by this peruerſe Teacher. For this is the Myſtery of iniquitie, and ſecret Cabala of the Roman Rabbins: when they giue the glorious title of inerrabilitie to the Catholike or generall Church, they all the while meane none other then their Miſtreſſe, the Lady of the ſeuen hilled city, and other Churches, as ſubiugated to her, and made her hand-maides, or rather ſlaues. But wee will follow this queſtion in the generall ſtile and appellation of the Church, as it is here propounded in termes.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Confuted by their owne Bible.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, we find in it the Churches defection foretold by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 31. 16. <hi>This people</hi> (meaning Iſrael the Church of God then) <hi>will fornicate after ſtrange gods, forſake me, &amp;c.</hi> Foretold by the Prophet <hi>Azariah,</hi> 2. Chron. 15. 2. Many dayes ſhall paſſe in Iſrael without the true God, without Prieſt, a Teacher, and without the Law. Foretold by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Theſ. 2. 2, 12. where he ſpeakes of a reuolt, and ſuch a reuolt, as thereby the Man of ſinne gets vp to ſeate himſelfe in the Temple of God, drawing to him ſuch as haue not a loue of the truth. Foretold by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 1. In you, lying Maſters, which ſhall bring in ſects of perdition. By Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Reuelation, where the Church is foreſhewed to proue a bloody Whore, Chap. 17. Now what is foretold, certainely doth, or ſhall come to paſſe. Therefore the Church may erre.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee find in their owne Bible, that the Prophets in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1814:52"/> old time found the Church guiltie, not onely of morall crimes, but alſo of errors in doctrine, Eſay 48. 4, 5, 8. and in Ezech. 16. 15, 35. where ſhe is ſet out as a lewd Strumpet. And in Chap. 20. 8. raxed for idolatrie aforetime. The Prophecie of <hi>Ieremie</hi> condemneth the Church in his time for many abominations committed in Ieruſalem, and in Egypt. Our Sauiour found the Church at his comming corrupted with falſe doctrine, the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the Scribes and Phariſes; warning his Diſciples to take heed thereof, Mat. 16. 6, 12. How the Churches of Galatia did erre, and were bewitched, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth vs, Gal. 1. and 3. and 4. And the Churches in Aſia, as Pergamus, and Thyatira are taxed, and found fault with, Reuel. 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we find in their Bible by the hiſtorie thereof, that the Church hath erred euen from the very beginning.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. In Paradiſe our firſt Parents, the firſt Church that euer God had, and the moſt perfect for knowledge, holineſſe and righteouſneſſe; yet this Church erred, and fell fearefully; in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods Word, in taking from it, and in beleeuing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill before God. What Church is it then, which may not erre?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. After their caſting out of Paradiſe, till the Flood, the Church, that is, the ſonnes of God, went vnto the daughters of men, by which mixture the whole earth became corrupted, Gen. 6. which error in fact came out of a dogmaticall error in iudgement.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. From the Flood to <hi>Abraham;</hi> in which ſpace we reade of open rebellion againſt God, Gen. 11. and that there was ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie committed in the Church by <hi>Thare</hi> and <hi>Nachor</hi> in Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia, from amongſt whom <hi>Abraham</hi> was called out, Ioſh. 24. 2, 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. From <hi>Abrahams</hi> comming into Canaan, till Iſraels comming out of Egypt. In this ſpace idolatrie was crept into the Church; into <hi>Iacobs</hi> Family, Gen. 35. 2. And Iſrael is taxed for committing idolatry in Egypt, Ioſh. 24. 14. and for being obſtinate therein, Ezech. 20. 8. and 16. 15, 35. and 23. 8.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. In Iſraels going into Canaan, during their aboade in the Wilderneſſe; they erred in heart alwaies, they knew not the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1814:53"/> Lords wayes, but mightily prouoked him, Pſal. 94. 9, 10, 11. and they committed horrible idolatry, both <hi>Aaron</hi> the chiefe Prieſt, the Heads of the people, beſides the reſt, Exod. 32. 4, 5, 8, 31. They were a peruerſe generation, of which reade Pſal. 77. 8. 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 36, 40, 41, 56, 57. the whole Pſalme ſheweth, that they greatly erred.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. In Canaan in the dayes of the Iudges, how often fell they into horrible idolatry, ſeruing other gods, and doing what liked themſelues, Iudg. 2. 10, 11, 12, 13. and 5. 8. and 6. 25, 26. and 8. 33. and 9. 4. 27. and 10. 6. and 21. 25. In <hi>Ely</hi> his time was a miſerable ſtate of the Church and Religion, 1. Sam. 2. In <hi>Sauls</hi> time men did not ſeeke to the Arke of God, 1. Chron. 13. 3.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. From <hi>Salomons</hi> reigne, to the captiuitie, were great abominations. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſet vp, or fauoured in others the ſetting vp of idolatrie, the remainders whereof continued vnto <hi>Ioſiah</hi> his dayes. The ten Tribes fell to idolatrie, and neuer returned. Iudah often committed great wickedneſſe, as in the dayes of <hi>Rehoboam, Iehoram, Amaziah, Ioas, Ahaz, Manaſſes, Amon,</hi> and other Kings, which ſucceeded godly <hi>Ioſias;</hi> and the people are often complained of to haue done corruptly, and to haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt God, euen in good Kings daies, 2. Chron. 17. 2. and 33. 17. and 36. 14. for which God heauily plagued them, 2. Chr. 28. 6. For more euidence of the euils in this ſpace, reade the Prophets, Eſay 48. 45. and 56. 10, 11. Ier. 2. 27, 28. and 3. 1, 2. and 5. 31. and 6. 14. Ezech. 69, 11, 12, 15. Hoſea 2. 2.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. From thence to Chriſt: The Prieſts, as <hi>Malachi</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, had departed out of the way, and made voide the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Mal. 2. 8. had deſpiſed and polluted his name, Mal. 1. 6, 12. they did not lay to heart his commandements, Mal. 2. 2. <hi>Iudah</hi> is accuſed to haue tranſgreſſed, and that abominations were done in Iſrael, and in Ieruſalem, that they had contaminated the ſanctification of the Lord, and had the daughter of a ſtrange god, Mal. 2. 11. In the ſecond of Machabees we may reade of horrible corruptions in the high Prieſts. <hi>Iaſon</hi> got the office by money brought his Country-men to the Heathen rites; the Prieſts were not occupied about the offices of the Altar, but the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1814:53"/> Temple and Sacrifices were neglected, 2. Machab. 4. 7, 11, 14. And when our Sauiour was come, he found many ſects, falſe Teachers corrupting the truth, Matth. 6. and 16. 6, 12. and 23. 16, 22. &amp; was by the outward pretending domineering Church then in Councell condemned, and put to death. To conclude of the chiefe Rulers in this Church, the ſaying of <hi>Steuen,</hi> that they were ſtiffe-necked, and vncircumciſed in heart and eares, alwaies reſiſting the holy Ghoſt, Act. 7. Who can reade theſe things, and thinke yet, that the Church cannot erre; if withall they would conſider, how this Church of Iſrael had the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meanes for direction and confirmation?</p>
                  <p n="1">I. They had the written Word, and ordinary Teachers, the Prieſts and Leuites daily inſtructing them, Deut. 33. 10. Acts 15. 21.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. They had extraordinary teaching; 1. By God himſelfe from Heauen, Exod. 20. By Vrim and Thummim, by Viſion and Dreames. 2. By Prophets, <hi>Moſes, Samuel, Eliah, Eliſha,</hi> and very many moe. 3. By Kings endued with a Propheticall Spirit, as <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon.</hi> 4. At length, by Ieſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe perſonally. 5. By the twelue Apoſtles, Mat. 10. 6. By the 70. diſciples, Luk. 10. 1. Neuer ſuch, nor ſo many in any Church, ſince God had a Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. They had Miracles and wonders in bringing them out of Egypt, in the fearefull giuing of the Law, in carrying them thorow the Wolderneſſe, in planting them in Canaan, and in ſtrange Miracles wrought in <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha's</hi> time, and in ſome of the Kings of Iudah. Chriſt confirmed his doctrine, and ſo did the Apoſtles and Diſciples their teaching by Miracles, Luk. 10. 17. No Church vnder the Heauen had euer the like.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. They had great mercies and vnheard of deliuerances from their Enemies: from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt drowned in the Red Sea: from the Amalekites, diſcomfited by <hi>Moſes</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: from the innumerable multitude of Enemies, the Kings of Canaan, of Midian, Philiſtims, Syrians, Aſſyrians: from the Hoſt of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> nine ſcore thouſand ſlaine by an Angell in one night, Kings thirtie two, beſides <hi>Benhadad,</hi> with an infinite Hoſte defeated, by onely 7000. and odde: <hi>Ionathan</hi> and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-bearer
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1814:54"/> did terrifie an whole Campe: <hi>Gideon</hi> and three hundred men made an innumerable multitude to ſhe away, and with a few other of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> did ſlay of them in one day one hundred and twenty thouſand: <hi>Aſa</hi> vanquiſhed the Army of the Ethiopians, ten hundred thouſand, beſides three hundred Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets. <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> gathered the ſpoile of his enemies, three Kings comming with their Hoſts againſt him, whom God ſet one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, to deſtroy vtterly one another for his ſafetie and enriching. What ſhall I ſpeake of Hoſtes flying for feare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any purſuing of them? For other bleſſings and mercies they are not to be numbred.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. They had ſtrange and moſt terrible puniſhments vpon them, to keep them in the feare of God, to make them to know him, and to walke in his waies: fire from Heauen deuouring vp ſome, the earth ſwallowing vp quicke other-ſome, the giuing of them often into the hands of Heathen Kings to oppreſſe them, that they might turne from Idolatry; yea, at length ſent them all into captiuitie for 70. yeeres.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee, for Teachers, for Wonders and Miracles, for Mercies and Iudgements, none euer to be compared to them. Papiſts may fame Legends to parallel theſe; but theſe are truths, hauing witneſſe from Gods Word it ſelfe. And yet this Church erred, and as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, chap. 48 4, 8. was ſtubborne, had a neck as an Iron ſinew, and her forehead as braſſe, and was a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſour from the wombe.</p>
                  <p>If the Papiſts make little account of theſe reaſons, as nothing to keepe a Church from erring; yet is it much more then their Romiſh Church can ſay for her ſelfe. Let them ſay what they can for the Churches not erring, and we will ſee whether this Church of Iſrael cannot ſay the ſame alſo.</p>

                  <p>From Chriſts comming, till <hi>Iohns</hi> being in Pathmos. In this ſpace we may finde errours in the Church. The Apoſtles themſelues before Chriſts Aſcenſion, were in an error touching Chriſt his Kingdome, dreaming of a temporall kingdome, Act. 1. 6. Luk. 24. 21. of reſtoring the kingdome to Iſrael, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming them: ſo as they did ſtriue among themſelues, which of them ſhould be greateſt, Luk 22. 24. and hereupon it was, that the mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children deſired of him for her ſonnes, that one might ſit in his Kingdome, on the right hand, and the other on the left, Mat. 20. 20, 21. Their knowledge was very imperfect; for it is ſaid often, that they vnderſtood not many things, Mat 15. 16. Luk. 9. 45. and 10. 34. Ioh. 12. 16. and 29. yea, ſo ſlow of heart, and dull of hearing they were, that Chriſt telleth them, that he had many things to ſay to them, but that then they were not able to beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Ioh. 16. 12. their faith was verie weake, as appeareth by his calling of them,

                  <p>After Chriſts Aſcenſion, and the comming downe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, they were ignorant for a time in this, that they did not thinke it was lawfull to go to the Gentiles; as we may ſee in <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 10 15. 20. and the other Iewes, verſ. 45. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Cap. 11. 2, 3, 18, 19. The Churches of Galatia er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, that he feared leſt hee had laboured in vaine, Gal. 4. 11. I neede not here ſpeake of errors, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies creeping in, troubling the Church, and deceiuing many, as in Act. 15. 2. 1. Tim 1. 3 6, 7, 19. 20. 2. Tim 2. 18, 19. 1.

S. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth <hi>Timothy,</hi> that all that were in Aſia were departed from him, 2. Tim. 1. 15. Thus was the Churches ſtate euen in the Apoſtles dayes.

                  <p>II. Here is no promiſe, that the Church ſhall not erre; but that he will beſtow on them, which exerciſe the Miniſtery, his Spirit, and his Word continually for the Churches good.</p>
                  <p>III. If he will needs hence conclude, that the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre: 1. He muſt proue, that the Teachers doe euer teach the truth by Gods Spirit, and by Gods Word, which are to go together, Ioh. 14. 26. and 16. 13. Mat. 18. 19, 20. 2. That the hearers, the members of the Church, doe euer receiue, beleeue and follow their Teachers thus teaching by the Word and holy Spirit, which two things reſt for him to make good <hi>ad Graecas Calendas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. This promiſe made, muſt needs be vnderſtood condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally of the viſible Church, and of an ordinary Miniſtery: for <hi>Eſay</hi> tells vs afterwords, how they vexed Gods Spirit, chap. 63. 10. We ſee how the Church of the Iſraelites, and that at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem hath been caſt off of God, and hath now neither Word nor Spirit of God to direct it. Chriſt found her Teachers in his time full of errors, as they grieuouſly erred before, 2. King. 16. 11. 2. Chron. 36. 14, 16. Eſay 56. 10. Ier. 5. 1. Mal. 2. 8. And we know by experience in our times, and by faithfull relation aforetimes, that Teachers haue erred; and people haue not euer embraced the truth, when ſound Teachers haue deliuered it; let Chriſts hearers be inſtance for all, and thoſe in Iury which heard the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
                  <p>V. If this were a good argument, where Gods Spirit and his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1814:57"/> Word is, there can be no errour; then would it follow, that no ordinary member of Chriſt ſhould euer erre; for ſuch a one hath Gods Spirit, 1. Ioh. 2. 20, 27. Rom. 8. 9. 2. Cor. 1. 21. and his Word, Deut. 33. 3. by which they become beleeuers, Ioh. 17. 20. But this, I hope, a Papiſt will not grant, and yet the argument is the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Ioh. 14. 16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall giue you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for euer, euen the Spirit of truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This place is primarily to be vnderſtood of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, to whom the promiſe of guiding into all truth, was a <hi>ſpeciall priuiledge,</hi> Mat. 10. 20. Ioh. 14. 26. and 16. 13.</p>
                  <p>2. Of the ſucceeding Teachers, but with no ſuch ſpeciall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge: for firſt, there are no ſuch promiſes made to them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, experience teacheth, that they haue wanted this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Thirdly, the hearers haue libertie to ſearch and trie that which is deliuered, if they doubt, 1. Theſ. 5. 21. 1. Ioh. 4. 1. Ioh. 5. 39. Act. 17. 11. <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> one of their owne ſide, ſaith<note place="margin">Li. 2. ca. 19. de Doct. ſid.</note> of particular Paſtors and Biſhops, <hi>We know that theſe haue often erred.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Neither the abiding of <hi>the Spirit for euer</hi> where it is, nor the title of <hi>Spirit of truth</hi> will enforce euer an infallibility in teaching; for it is called the Spirit of <hi>ſanctification</hi> or holineſſe, Rom. 1. 4. for that he worketh in vs holineſſe, and is euer abiding in the godly, who are the Temple of the holy Ghoſt; and yet are they not ſo ſanctified, but they often offend in life. So is it the Spirit of truth, becauſe it enlightneth the minds of men with onely that which is truth, and guideth them in the truth, if they follow their guide: but if they doe not, they may, yea, and doe erre from the truth.</p>
                  <p>Mat. 18. 17. <hi>If he neglect to heare the Church, let him be to thee as an Heathen, and a Publican.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is meant of an euident caſe proued by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes before the Church in matters of offence, betweene one priuate man and another; wherein the Church may giue right ſentence, if ſhe will; yet we ſee, ſuch as meddle in the Churches cenſures, doe not euer proceede aright. This place therefore is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1814:58"/> not to the matter of doctrine and determination of faith, the point in queſtion; neither doth it proue, that in her cenſure the Church cannot erre: for ſaith their owne <hi>Panormitan,</hi> as before is cited, <hi>A generall Councell repreſenting the whole Church, may erre, in excommunicating him that ſhould not be excommunicate.</hi> Theſe words ſpeake not of the Churches either not erring or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but of other hearing the Church, and how they ſhould car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelues towards ſuch, as will not in ſo cleare a caſe heare the Churches admonition.</p>
                  <p>3. Its not here commanded, that he ſhould be held as a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Publican, that would not heare the Church in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhe ſaith: for Chriſt here ſpeakes of the Iewiſh Church then, as appeareth by the name Heathen and Publican, which were abhorred of the Iewiſh Church. Now, that Church (wee reade) did excommunicate a blind man (which receiued ſight) for his profeſſing of Chriſt, Ioh. 9. 34. and had agreed to put any man out of the Synagogue, which ſhould confeſſe Ieſus to bee Chriſt, v 22. and did alſo forbid to teach in his name, Act. 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>4. This place is ſpoken of ſome Eccleſiaſticall Gouernours, (if it be extended to vs) hauing the power of cenſures in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church; which the Learned in their Church doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, may erre; and therefore this helpes not to proue, that the Church cannot erre.</p>
                  <p>Eſay 35. 8. <hi>And a high way ſhall be there, and away, and it ſhall be called. The way of holineſſe, the vncleane ſhall not paſſe ouer it, but it ſhall be for thoſe: the way-faring men, though fooles, ſhall not erre therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. This verſe is wholly allegoricall, and therfore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo well be inforced for dogmaticall proofe, without a full explanation of the words; which the <hi>Gagger</hi> ſhould haue done.</p>
                  <p>II. It is altogether againſt himſelfe in the expoſition, if hee either durſt, or had been able to haue ſet it downe: for by <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> may be vnderſtood the common profeſſion or points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for good and bad, as the high-way is for all; then the way of holineſſe is taken for a more ſtrict profeſſion, or more ſtraight Rules of Religion. If ſo, then conſider the perſons who they bee, that ſhall not erre in this way: hee doth not ſay, The
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1814:58"/> Church, or the learned Church men, or men in holy Orders; for are theſe fooles? but <hi>wayfaring men, though fooles, ſhall not erre.</hi> Here is a promiſe, that the ſimple Laytie ſhall not miſtake their way; which Popiſh Teachers cannot abide to heare of. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſhall any vncleane paſſe ouer this way:</hi> but they teach, that their Church Catholike conſiſts of elect and reprobate, both good and bad, cleane and vncleane. Therefore in a ſpirituall ſenſe the words are to be vnderſtood of the onely ſanctified by Gods Spirit, here trauelling in this World as wayfaring men; and though eſteemed as fooles, yet are ſo guided in their holy profeſſion, as they ſhall not bee ſuffered to wander out of the way of life, neither totally nor finally. But he will ſay, If theſe ſhall not erre, then much leſſe ſhall the Church. True, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it? we doe not ſay, that all the whole Church, and all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that euer haue been, ſuch as this place ſpeaketh of, haue all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this thouſand yeeres, as the <hi>Gagger</hi> beares his Reader in hand, making him beleeue, that we ſo teach. Here the Prophet ſpeakes of the Lords redeemed ſeparated from the vncleane, in a ſpirituall eſtate, in and by Chriſt; but in our diſpute we ſpeake of the viſible Church of cleane and vncleane, good and bad, and of a mixt company.</p>
                  <p>III. This verſe, and the whole chapter, ſpeakes in the firſt place, of the returne from Captiuitie, which the Prophet doth expreſſe in figuratiue ſpeeches, to ſet out the comfort thereof moſt liuely: and ſo it is nothing to the purpoſe, for which the <hi>Gagger</hi> brings it. In a high ſenſe it ſets out the ſpirituall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the redeemed by Chriſt, partly here begun, and fully to be perfected in the day of the Churches perfect redemption.</p>
                  <p>IV. It ſpeakes not here of the Churches teaching, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Saints trauailing towards Heauen: But the word, <hi>not erre,</hi> made the <hi>Gagger</hi> thinke, he had obtained his purpoſe, and an expreſſe text for not erring in Doctrine, when the words ſpeake of a way, a high-way, of trauailing men, and others not paſſing ouer it, and of the redeemeds walking, verſ. 9. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnderſtood of not erring in life, it cannot be taken abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for error of life is in the beſt, but they erre not to finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1814:59"/>
                  <p>Epheſ. 5. 27. <hi>That hee might preſent it to himſelfe a glorious Church, not hauing ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Our diſpute is of the viſible Church, and mixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; this is to be vnderſtood only of the body, whereof Chriſt in the moſt proper ſenſe, is the Head and Sauiour, verſ. 9. which hee nouriſheth and cheriſheth, verſ. 29. betweene whom and Chriſt thereis ſuch an vnion, as it is called a great Myſtery, verſ. 32. which cannot properly be meant of viſible Churches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting not onely of Elect, but alſo of Reprobates, who are not clenſed, nor nouriſhed, or cheriſhed, as members of his body, nor made euer glorious.</p>
                  <p>II. The Apoſtle ſpeakes heere of the Church either as triumphant, or, if as militant, then as it is in preparing, and as it ſhall bee hereafter in Heauen: for in this life, it is not altogether ſpotleſſe, without wrinkle or blemiſh, Cant. 1. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>III. This place doth ſerue rather to prooue her puritie in life, then infallibilitie of iudgement in teaching: this latter is hence farre fetched; the former may ſeeme more apparant. But will any beleeue, that Gods Church for life and conuerſation, is in this life without ſpot, wrinkle or blemiſh?</p>
                  <p>1. Tim. 3. 15. <hi>The Church of the liuing God, the ground and pillar of truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe this place is much vrged by others, and the laſt of this <hi>Gaggers,</hi> I will more fully make anſwer vnto it. Hence hee would conclude, that the Church cannot erre; he meaneth the Church of Rome, the Pope, at leaſt, the virtuall Church; for they defend not now any Church from errour, but their owne. But this they can neuer proue out of the place.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> how he ſhould behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Church, 1. Tim. 3. 14. So his Epiſtle, that is, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall written Word, was made to be <hi>Timothies</hi> rule, to guide him from erring, and not the Churches determination. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for all this his praiſe of the Church, ſent him not to Her, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him a written Word, to direct him in gouerning of her, which hee would not haue done, if by calling the Church, the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1814:59"/> pillar and ground of truth, he had meant ſhe could not haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh thus of the then preſent Church of Epheſus, where <hi>Timothy</hi> was, chap. 1. 3. built vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Epheſ. 2. 20. and yet ſhe ſoone left her firſt Loue, Reuel. 2. 4. and after fell away.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The word <hi>Church</hi> comprehendeth all the faithfull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at Epheſus: ſo the Church of Epheſus is taken, Reuel. 2. 1. But our Aduerſaries will not haue the people (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles allowed, Act. 15. 22.) with their Biſhops and Paſtors, to be the Church, and with them to approue of matters of Faith: For the Romiſh Clergie thinke of the people, as did the hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Phariſes, that they know not the Law, and are curſed, Ioh. 7. 49. Except they allow the people alſo with the Teachers, to be the pillar and ground of truth, this place doth not ſerue their turne.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. If the word <hi>Church</hi> bee taken for any other particular Church, to which <hi>Timothie,</hi> as an Euangeliſt, might goe, after the Apoſtles planting of them, then from hence the Papiſts cannot conclude that which they would: for firſt, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that particular Churches may erre. Secondly, its euident by Scripture, in the Churches of Galatia, Gal. 1. and 3. 1. and 4. 10, 11. by hiſtorie, and by experience. Now, the Church of Rome was neuer other then a particular Church, in the beſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eſtate thereof. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writes to it no otherwiſe, then to a particular Church.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. If it be taken for the Vniuerſall Church; this helpes not them. For firſt, theirs is not the vniuerſall, but a particular Church, as is proued after in the ſixteenth queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is abſurd to reaſon from that which is not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, nor can euer aſſemble together to come to the triall, if it were queſtionable.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The intituling of the Church, to bee the pillar and ground of truth, wil not afford the concluſion of not erring, and that for theſe Reaſons. Firſt, becauſe the words are metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, and a ſimilitude muſt be extended no farther then is in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Now, the Church is called the pillar and ground, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1814:60"/> ſhee cannot erre: but firſt, for that ſhe hath the Apoſtles writings committed to her, as were the Oracles of God to the Iewes, Rom 3. 2. which <hi>Apoſtles writings are</hi> (ſaith <hi>Irenous) the pillars and ſupporters of our faith; the proofes, foundations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Li. 3. ca. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and the grounds of our cauſe,</hi> as Saint <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>De vnit. Eccl. ca.</hi> 16. On this 1. Tim. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeakes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as <hi>Lyra</hi> thinkes, it is ſo called, for that the Church doth maintaine the truth of the Goſpell, euen in the greateſt perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and, as other iudge, for that it vpholdeth the truth, that it may not fall to the ground, though it be afflicted; and becauſe by words and examples it confirmes our Faith. Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſpeakes according to the vſe of pillars in old time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, on which their Lawes, written in Tables, were hanged vp for people to reade: yea, ſome wrote the Lawes vpon pillars themſelues. So as the Church here is reſembled to thoſe pillars, which hath the Bookes of holy Lawes, to ſhew them, and to vphold them, and to exhibite them out vnto all to bee ſeene and read.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was counted a Pillar, Gal. 2 9. and yet he erred, euen in not walking according to the truth of the Goſpell, verſ. 14.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth ſo the Church at <hi>Epheſus</hi> then, as ſhe was, and ſo long to be ſo eſteemed as ſhe ſhould continue. Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Hebrewes telleth them, that they with himſelfe and others, are the Houſe of Chriſt, if (ſaith he) we hold faſt the confidence, and the reioycing of the hope firme vnto the end: implying, that if they did not, they ſhould not be ſo. Can any well conclude from that, which one is at the preſent, that he ſhall euer be the ſame? Then had not our firſt Parents fallen; nor <hi>Salomon</hi> been an Idolater; nor the Iſraelites now, none of Gods people; nor Rome, (as ſhe is) ſpirituall Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, becauſe not the name and title of the <hi>Houſe of God</hi> it ſelf (by which name the Church is called here, in 1. Tim. 3. 15. as alſo beleeuers are called by the name of <hi>the houſhold of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 19.) will afford this their concluſion. For the Church of Epheſus, ſo called, did erre. Now, may it not be inferred from hence, that ſhe is called the Houſe, and beleeuers the Houſhold?
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1814:60"/> and may it be inferred, becauſe ſhe is called a pillar only, or ſtay, to vphold the houſe? Will not the whole houſe, nor the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold yeeld it? And will a pillar, or prop, make it good? Very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is onely vpon the praiſe giuen to the Church, that this concluſion is made. Is this then good arguing; Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer prayſes the Church hath, that for which, or wherein ſhee is prayſed, ſhe hath it in perfection? Here ſhe is called the pillar and ground of truth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> (ſay they) ſhe cannot erre. See the like reaſoning; She is the houſhold of Faith, Gal. 6. 10. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſhe neuer hath any doubting. Yet this they deny, and hold here to haue no certaine aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, conſider the truth, of which ſhee is the pillar and ground. <note n="*" place="margin">On this place, Ioh. 5. 23</note> 
                     <hi>Oecumenius</hi> vnderſtands it in oppoſition to the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes in the Temple vnder the Law; there the type, here the truth; there the ſhadow, here the ſubſtance. But the Temple was onely the pillar and ground, that is, the appointed place where the knowledge and vſe of the Ceremoniall Law was had and vpheld: ſo onely is now the Church, the place where the diuine truth is to be found, and is in practice, and no where elſe. <hi>Truth</hi> in Scripture is taken for the Word of God, Ioh. 17. 17. and 8. 31, 32. the Goſpell, the Word of truth, Col. 1. 5. Gal. 5. 7. euen the Myſtery of godlineſſe, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this place of the 1. Tim. 3. 16. enterpreteth the Word, <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then, the Church of God is the pillar and ground or ſtay of Gods Word and his Goſpell, euen the myſterie of godlineſſe. This ſhe receiueth, keepeth, beareth vp, publiſheth to the world, and is the ground whereon it doth reſt, and no where elſe in the world. What then? Is ſhe, or it the Rule? Is her authoritie aboue it, or it aboue her? The King committeth to ſome the publike Records, to keepe and to publiſh to other. Is their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie greater then theſe? Are their words of force, without the warrant of thoſe Records? Or is it not poſſible for theſe keepers of them, to erre in their proceedings? We know the contrary. The Iewes had the Oracles of God committed to them, Rom. 3. 2. but haue not they erred? The Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Epheſus, Galatia, Philippi, Coloſſe, Theſſalonica, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1814:61"/> and other Churches in the Eaſt, had the new Teſtament committed to them; yet haue they, we ſee, erred. So hath the Church of Rome very ſhamefully, as the Epiſtle written to them doth teſtifie, if her now new doctrine be examined by it. The Church therefore, the viſible mixt company, of whom all our diſpute is, may erre.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Caiaphas</hi> was a wicked man many wayes, and in part an vſurper, as the Rhemiſts confeſſe: a very fit patterne &amp; Patron for the Pope. But to anſwer to the place obiected, for the Popes not erring: Firſt, this was but once by ſpeciall direction, and therefore cannot hence be concluded any perpetuall aſſurance of direction. Its cleare by that which followed: for this man in another Councell, Mat. 26. 57, 59. heard and accepted of falſe witneſſes, condemned Chriſt for a blaſphemer, verſ. 60. 62, 65. and in another Aſſembly tooke counſell to put him to death, Mat. 27. 1. Secondly, this ſpeaketh of propheſie, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie gift to this man then. Thirdly, though the man here was a lewd wicked vſurper; yet was his office of Gods own appointment. What is this to the Popes Antichriſtian ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, an office of the diuell, and not of Gods ordinance? Fourthly, If this place afford aſſurance of an vnerring ſpirit to the Pope, it muſt be either in reſpect of the mans perſon, or office, or chaire he ſate in. But none of theſe. Firſt, not of his perſon, who was a wicked vſurper, and Chriſts enemie. And will the Pope plead his perſon? Secondly, not of his office, for that is changed, as the Apoſtle in Hebrewes doth witneſſe. Thirdly, not of the chaire; for the ſeate had no ſuch vertue in it to keepe him ſafe from error, as before is noted in Mat 26. 57, 59, 61, 62, 65. and 27. 1. for the chaire either had then loſt his vertue, and then can it not keepe from error: or it was not the chaires vertue which made <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to propheſie; and then is it idle to boaſt of the chaire: or elſe paraduenture the vertue was in it, but not alwayes operatiue; and then is it vncertaine, when
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1814:65"/> it will worke, to keepe the man from error which ſits therein, ſo as he may ſome time or other erre, or be left in doubt whether he doth erre or no. This being the ſtate of that chaire, how can the Pope clayme an vnerring ſpirit from this? Fourthly, though the Euangeliſt <hi>Iohn,</hi> guided by Gods Spirit, did expound the meaning of the words otherwiſe then <hi>Caiphas</hi> euer meant them; yet thoſe in Councell with him, vnderſtood them not ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but tooke them as vttred in State policie, for outward peace and ſafetie of the Nation; as is cleare in Ioh. 11. 48, 53. So as he erred in his owne ſcope, and they in apprehending the words in another drift and ſenſe, then God did intend by them. Therfore as <hi>Caiphas</hi> and his companie herein erred, ſo may the Pope and conclaue of Cardinals, for any helpe to the contrary that they can get from this place.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is ſpoken of <hi>Peter,</hi> and not of the Pope. 2. This was in reſpect of a future lapſe in <hi>Peter,</hi> which Chriſt foreſaw, more then in any of the Apoſtles, as the euent decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 3. This is meant of <hi>Peters</hi> owne particular inward grace of faith, which was terribly ſhaken, when he denied and forſwore his Maſter, and not of his teaching in the execution of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie. For why ſhould Chriſt pray more for <hi>Peters</hi> teaching, then for the reſt, whom Chriſt ſent out as well as him, to teach all Nations?</p>
                  <p>Mat. 16. 18. This text is ſpoken vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> of the Churches preſeruation againſt the gates of hell: but ſpeaketh nothing of <hi>Peters</hi> not erring, much leſſe of the Popes; of whom Chriſt in this place neuer dreamed. And its cleare by Scripture, that the gates of hell preuailed againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> after Chriſt had vttered theſe words vnto him, though not totally and finally to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet in a great meaſure to tranſgreſſion, and fearefull fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>Mat. 23. 2. This is very largely anſwered before; and there is it fully proued, that theſe Scribes and Phariſes erred groſly in many things.</p>
                  <p>Ioh. 21. 15, 16, 17. This text ſpeakes of <hi>Peters</hi> dutie, that as he loued Chriſt, he ſhould feed his lambes; but ſpeakes not a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1814:65"/> word of his not erring, who after this was found ignorant in ſome things of the nature of Chriſts Kingdome, Act. 1. 6. of going to the Gentiles, and eating things forbidden by the Law, abrogated by Chriſt, Act. 10. 12, 14. and he alſo erred at Antioch, Gal. 2. But if this did cleare <hi>Peter,</hi> what maketh it for the Pope, who ſhewes no loue to Chriſt in feeding his lambes? If he neuer teach, then he may be ſure neuer to erre in that kind.</p>
                  <p>Exod. 28. 30. Firſt, what this Vrim and Thummim was, can no man tell. Secondly, though <hi>Aaron</hi> had it, yet he foully erred in the golden Calfe, in making it, in building an Altar before it, and proclaiming a feaſt thereupon to the Lord, Exod. 32. 4, 5 And did not <hi>Vrijah</hi> erre in the dayes of wicked <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2. King. 16. 11, 16? So the high Prieſt in Chriſts time? Therefore this place alledged to proue that the high Prieſt could not erre, is much abuſed. Thirdly, what is this to the Pope, who is neither Gods high Prieſt (for ſuch is there now none, but Ieſus Chriſt onely;) neither hath this Vrim &amp; Thummim, which <hi>Aaron</hi> had?</p>

And yet this text ſpeakes but of two or three gathered together.</p>
                  <p>III. Here is not a word of not erring, nor of infallibilitie in doctrine, but of Chriſt his preſence with them. But from this it followes not, that they cannot erre. For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>know in part.</hi> But with thoſe which the Apoſtle comprehendeth vnder the word, <hi>Wee,</hi> was Chriſt preſent. And if they knew but in part (perfection of knowledge not being to be attained vnto here) as the Apoſtle there teacheth; ſeeing imperfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may erre, it is euident that they might erre, though Chriſt be preſent with them: for he is with his Saints, but he doth not perfectly ſanctifie them; his Spouſe hath imperfections in this life, neither doth hee perfectly illuminate them, but they haue their miſtakes. Chriſt was with his before his death, yet had they errors: and before his Aſcenſion; yet he found them igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his ſpirituall Kingdome, Luk. 24. Act. 1. And after his Aſcenſion, and comming of the holy Ghoſt, euen <hi>Peter</hi> was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, Act. 10. and other of the Church, Act. 11. as before is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
                  <p>IV. What is this text to proue Popiſh Councels not to erre? For this Scripture ſpeakes of ſuch as are gathered in Chriſts name, whereas thoſe Councels are gathered in the Popes name. Chriſt promiſeth to bee with thoſe that are gathered in his name: but will it neceſſarily follow, that hee will therefore bee with thoſe that are gathered in the Popes name? This ſtands in neede of proofe, eſpecially ſeeing the Pope is proued to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, with whom, we may be ſure, Chriſt will keepe no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>Ioh. 6. 13. <hi>The Spirit of truth will guide you into all truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. This is a promiſe vnto the Apoſtles, whoſe prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue in their Miniſtery was not to erre, becauſe they were the chiefe builders and planters of Chriſtian Religion. All other

                  <p>II. It is one thing for a Guide to leade aright, &amp; another for thoſe that ſhould follow, to follow aright. It therefore will not be neceſſarily concluded, that becauſe a perfect Guide leadeth the way, ſuch as come after, cannot, or doe not goe out of the way. For they may not ſtrictly follow the Guide, but now and then may ſlip out of the way, through want of eie-ſight, or dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſight, or through careleſneſſe, looking ſome other way, not minding the Guide.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This was a Councell gathered of all the 12. Apoſtles, of the Elders at Ieruſalem, and of the whole Church. 2. This had the guiding of the holy Ghoſt, as the text witneſſeth. 3. This laid the Scriptures for their ground, verſ. 15. and the manifeſt euidence of the worke of the holy Ghoſt, verſ. 8 which they tooke for direction in their decrees. 4. Here was free libertie of diſputation, without interruption, one attentiuely hearing another, without by-reſpect, that the truth might take place. What is this to Popiſh Councels? Are there any Apoſtles? Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit they freely the whole Church? Are they guided by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and by the verity of holy Scriptures? Is libertie there granted to euery one to ſpeake freely? If they cannot proue theſe, this text ſerues not their turne.</p>

To which prayſes the beleeuers at Rome did not then attaine, though they had their prayſes, and thoſe great too, Rom. 15. 14. but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable with thoſe Churches.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, in ſhewing how the Apoſtles honoured ſome other Churches by their writings.

                  <p>5.

                  <p>6. Their Bible telleth vs, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtle to them that were in Rome called Saints, and beloued of God, ſo that they were within that City, or there-about: but the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church was then diſperſed; for the Goſpell at that time had gone into all the World, and was preached to euery creature vnder Heauen, Col. 1. 6, 23.

Their titles were Saints, Rom. 1. 7. beloued of God, alſo brethren, Rom. 10. 1. and 12. 1. and 15. 14, 30. Their faith, the ſame that was among all Nations, Rom. 1. 5. called the common Faith, verſ. 12. and therefore ſpoken of throughout the whole World, verſ. 8.

In that he ſaith, Not ſo much verified, as of Rome; he grants it to haue beene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of other Churches, though not ſo much: he cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from a higher degree conclude, that ſhe is onely the Church, whereof the promiſes are made. The words are ſpoken of Chriſts Kingdom in plain termes expreſſed. And is his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome now become the Romiſh Iuriſdiction onely? His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, after he aſſumed our nature, began before the Church of Rome had a being. And can any thinke that <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Pſalme, or the Angell ſpeaking the words to his Mother, in <hi>Luke,</hi> did dreame of a Pope-holy Father, and his Churches iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction?

                  <p>But ſaith the <hi>Gagger,</hi> No faith or Goſpell hath, or is ſo dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all the world, nor hath fructified, as the faith of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church hath done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Where is in the Text, Rome, or the Romiſh Church?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by ſaying, no faith or Goſpell, <hi>hath</hi> or <hi>is</hi> ſo dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſpeaking in the time paſt, and preſent; hee playeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull Merchant, by making two different things one. 1. For by the time paſt and moſt ancient, muſt bee meant the faith and Goſpell in the Church, planted in other places as well as at Rome in the Apoſtles dayes, of which this place of the Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſpeaketh: and by the time preſent, is vnderſtood the faith and profeſſion of the now Romiſh Church, greatly differing from that which the Apoſtle commended then, as before is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted out of the Epiſtle to the Romanes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in that he ſaith, <hi>no faith</hi> (meaning this preſent faith, for which hee onely ſtriueth) hath not been, nor is ſo dilated in all the world, fructified and growne, is not true. For firſt, the true faith, beginning at Ieruſalem, went farther being preached to euery creature vnder Heauen, Col. 1. 6, 23. Secondly, this our preſent faith (the very ſame with that Ancient faith, as I<note place="margin">See my Booke, <hi>Looke beyond Luther.</hi>
                     </note> haue proued) is dilated, fructified, and growne more then theirs. It is in both the Eaſt and Weſt Indies; it is in more King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in Europe, then the Pope hath full iuriſdiction in, as in England, Scotland, with all the adiacent Ilands belonging to both Kingdomes, which bee many, in Ireland, in Denmarke, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Lapland, and in other Countreys vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe Kings; in Pomeraine, in the Low. Countreys, in Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Princedomes, and in other places in Germany. Beſides that, it is in France, and ſome other places of the Popes Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. So that for ſpaciouſneſſe, wee be little behinde Rome.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1814:71"/> Hereto are to bee added the Ruſſian, Greeke, and Abyſſine Churches, as large as the European. In thoſe the Papacie is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vtterly vnknowne, or abhorred as vehemently as by vs. Thirdly, the faith and vnbeliefe of the Mahumetane Religion, is beyond the Romiſh preſent faith. Therefore as the Text hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth him not, ſo his boaſting is vaine, and falſe.</p>
                  <p>Rom. 1. 8. <hi>I thanke my God through Ieſus Chriſt for you all, that your faith is ſpoken of throughout the whole world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Gagger hauing cited this place, ſaith, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in expreſſe termes, calleth the faith of the whole world, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, The faith of the Romanes, that is to ſay, of the Romane Church. Therefore it is onely the Catholike Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Note here, that hee concludeth the Catholike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, from the faith of the Church: where therefore that is, which then was commended, muſt needs bee the Catholike Church, holding the Catholike faith as we doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, but what is this to the Romiſh Church now? For their preſent faith is not that which <hi>Paul</hi> commended then. This ſhould they proue. Is this good reaſoning; Such a mans word was of ſingular credit formerly, with euery man, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is ſo ſtill when hee is growne Bankerupt? Ieruſalem was the ioy of the whole earth, <hi>ergo</hi> it is ſo ſtill? Let this Gagger proue their faith now the ſame with that then, elſe this place will doe them no good, but rather vpbraideth their Apoſtaſie.</p>
                  <p>3. In this application of the words, hee erreth groſly, or rather, if it be not his error through ignorance, then it is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deceite, and ſo worſe, in calling it the faith of the Church of Rome, as if originally it had flowed from thence, and gone out thence into the world; when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth not any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of this Faith from thence, but that it was ſpoken of: which is to be vnderſtood of their receiuing of it, as it was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of other Nations, as is euident in Rom. 1. 5, 6. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of the <hi>Faith among all nations, among whom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they were called.</hi> So as thoſe at Rome were partakers with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the common faith preached in the world; and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe beholden to Rome for their faith, as this Gagger would inſinuate to his credulous Schollers.</p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:1814:71"/>
                  <p>This text therefore makes Rome no more the Catholicke Church, then Corinth, Philippi, Teſſalonica, &amp;c. which had receiued the ſame faith, though their receiuing of it was not perhaps ſo much ſpoken of, for the reaſons afore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged.</p>

They were all ordained to one and the ſame end; to bee with him, to goe and preach, Mar. 3. 14, 15. &amp; 16. 15. to be witneſſes of him to the vtmoſt parts of the Earth, Act. 1. 8. and all of them at the length to ſit and iudge the twelue Tribes of Iſrael, Mat. 19. 28. The Lord made no difference among them. If any had been, it may ſeeme to haue been in <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. For he, with his brother, was Chriſts neereſt kinſman. 2. He was called the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple whom Chriſt loued. 3. Hee and his Brother were called Boanerges, Mar. 3. 17. ſonnes of thunder. 4. He was euer one with Chriſt: as in his transfiguration, Math. 17. 1. and in other places, Mat. 26. 37. Mar. 5. 37. 5. Hee was the onely Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, after whom <hi>Peter</hi> made enquirie, what he ſhould doe, and of whom a ſaying went abroad, that he ſhould not dye. 6. He was the onely Diſciple, that went boldly in with Chriſt, and when he was in the High Prieſts houſe, hee brought in <hi>Peter.</hi> 7. He was the onely Diſciple that ſtood by Chriſt when he was vpon the Croſſe. 8. He was the onely Apoſtle to whom Chriſt committed his Mother, to take care of her. 9. Hee was the onely Apoſtle, which Chriſt would haue to call his Mother, Mother, and ſhe to hold him as her ſonne. 10. He, with <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> was the onely Apoſtle that did write a Goſpell, adding thereto three Epiſtles. 11. He was the onely Apoſtle that was rapt in Spirit on the Lords day, to receiue the Reuelation of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt by an Angell, foretelling the Churches eſtate to the worlds end. 12. Laſtly, hee was of all the reſt that liued, the longeſt, and alone after them all. In theſe was hee farre beyond <hi>Peter.</hi> He neuer denied his Maſter, as <hi>Peter</hi> did. Hee was neuer called Satan, as <hi>Peter</hi> was. Yet for all theſe excellencies in <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Papiſts will not haue any Chiefty in him. And ſurely, if theſe eminencies wil not afford him the Headſhip among them; it cannot be found in <hi>Peter,</hi> who attained not to ſuch excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>

                  <p>Math. 16. 19. <hi>I will giue vnto thee the Keyes, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Gagger will haue <hi>Peter</hi> chiefe, for that he ſuppoſeth the Keyes were giuen to him onely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The queſtion which Chriſt propounded, was to all the Apoſtles, verſe 13. 15. though <hi>Peter</hi> readieſt euer to ſpeake, made the anſwer; yet not onely for himſelfe, but for all the reſt, as appeareth in verſe 20, where our Sauiour commandeth them all, not <hi>Peter</hi> alone, not to tell that he was Chriſt which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they all knowing it, would haue profeſſed as much, if <hi>Peter</hi> had not preuented them. Therefore his anſwer beeing for all, Chriſts power giuen thereupon was generall to all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Keyes giuen, are no ſuch things as belong one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Peter;</hi> but are common to all. See before, an anſwer to this place.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the words following in this Text, <hi>Whatſoeuer thou ſhalt binde vpon earth, &amp;c.</hi> containing the action, or office of the Keyes, belong to all, Math. 18. 18. which power here was giuen not onely to <hi>Peter,</hi> but alſo to the other Apoſtles, by the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts owne confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Ieſus Chriſt, when hee breathed on them the Holy Ghoſt, Ioh. 21. 22, 23. (which with one bredth he gaue to all, ſaying, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo I ſend you</hi>) and gaue them all power of forgiuing, and retaining of ſinnes, which is the power of the Keyes here ſpoken of, Chriſt ſent all his Apoſtles, as his Father ſent him: Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> cannot haue more authoritie then the reſt, vnleſſe they can proue that <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent by Chriſt, otherwiſe then Chriſt himſelfe was ſent by his Father.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the words are a promiſe of giuing the Keyes, and power to bind and looſe, to remit and retain ſinnes, afterwards, and not the giuing of them now: but this promiſe, wee ſee, was not performed to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, but to all the Apoſtles, Ioh. 20. 23. not then naming <hi>Peter;</hi> and therefore this promiſe was made vnto all; and ſo intended to be performed, as the fulfilling ſheweth.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Fathers are of the ſame opinion with vs, touching the meaning of this Text: See before <hi>Origen, Ambroſe,</hi> and the ſame on Pſal. 39. <hi>Auſtin in Iohan. tract. 118. Theophylact</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:1814:75"/> on Mathew 16. <hi>Beda</hi> on this Text.</p>
                  <p>1. Cor. 3. 4, 22. <hi>One ſaith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>I am of</hi> Apollos, <hi>I am of</hi> Cephas, <hi>I of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gagger</hi> here from the order would proue <hi>Peter</hi> chiefe next Chriſt. Lo, ſaith he, how from thoſe, which he would haue eſteemed the leſſer, he aſcendeth to thoſe whom he would haue eſteemed the greater.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw</hi> 1. The mans wit went a grazing, when he wrote this. For if he ſo conclude from the order, then <hi>Paul</hi> muſt be inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to <hi>Apollos,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle and a Planter: but <hi>Apollos</hi> no Apoſtle, and onely a waterer, 1. Cor. 3. 6.</p>
                  <p>2. In Mat. 10. 2. he would haue <hi>Peter</hi> the chiefe, becauſe hee was named firſt: now here the chiefe, becauſe hee is named in a third place. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 9. puts him in the ſecond place betweene two: and will not they hold him the chiefe for this too? Doth not vertue conſiſt in the midſt? for put him in the firſt place, as in Mat. 10. in the third place, as in 1. Cor. 3. 4, 22. or in the ſecond, as in Gal. 2. 9. its with them a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Reaſon, to make him alwayes the chiefe; for he may take what place he liſteth. Deepe Diuinitie, and an inuincible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon! Though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in Gal. 2. takes himſelfe to be nothing inferiour to him, or to other which ſeemed to bee Pillars; and was inferiour to none of the great Apoſtles, 1. Cor. 11. 5. &amp; 12. 11. vpon this Text, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſhewes, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> compared himſelfe with the Apoſtles, euen with <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 22. 31. <hi>And the Lord ſaid,</hi> Simon, <hi>&amp;c. When thou art conuerted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This place proueth not any Headſhip ouer the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hee is called <hi>Simon,</hi> by his common name, and not <hi>Peter,</hi> which our Aduerſaries ſtand vpon, and make their chiefe argument.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this place is to forewarne him of his fearfull temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and ſo of his fall thereby, the vtter peril wherof he ſhould eſcape, not by himſelfe, or his owne power and grace, but by Chriſts mediation. What, is this to haue a Headſhip?</p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:1814:76"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, it teacheth him a duty, when hee ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and be recouered from vnder the fall, that hee ſhould confirme others. If by confirming, the <hi>Gagger</hi> will hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the practice and exerciſe of greatneſſe ouer the Apoſtles; then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had this greatneſſe too. For they did confirme others, Act. 14. 21. and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> Act. 15. 41. 1. Theſ. 3. 2. yea it is a common Duty of euery Paſtor. Is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that confirmeth, made thereby a Superiour in Rule, and Gouernment? Then a Prieſt confirming his Soueraigne, is his Superiour. And by this, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Peters</hi> Superiour: for he brought <hi>Peter</hi> backe from his by-path, both by reproofe, and publike teaching of the truth, and ſo confirmed him, who for feare did before goe aſtray, Gal. 2. 11, 17.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Lord Ieſus (if they will here vnderſtand the Apoſtles) calleth them <hi>Simons Brethren,</hi> and ſo giueth them equalitie.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, where are the <hi>Gaggers</hi> expreſſe words for <hi>Peters</hi> Headſhip, out of this place? Is it in ſtrengthening? A poore ſtrength to ſupport ſuch a Babyloniſh Tower.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 22. 26. <hi>He that is greateſt among you, let him be yonger, and he that is Chiefe, as he that doth ſerue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The words in the beginning of this verſe are againſt Chiefety; for it is ſaid, <hi>It ſhall not be ſo with you:</hi> when they were at ſtrife for Superioritie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the meaning of the Greateſt, and Chiefe, on which the <hi>Gagger</hi> doth faſten his teeth, doth not imply as hee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, any Chiefety among them: but Chriſt ſpeaketh according to their aſpiring minds; not of them, as any of them were, but as ſome of them deſired to be, as is cleare by the ſpeech and Petition of the Mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children, Mat. 20. 20, 27.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the occaſion and the very ſcope of the place, is againſt all Superioritie in the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it cannot be ſhewed, that any of them all did either claime, or practiſe any ſuperioritie; or taught in their writings any ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, they did ſtriue verſe 24. for ſuperioritie, which of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1814:76"/> them ſhould ſeeme the greater. As yet therefore there was no ſuch greatneſſe ſettled among them.</p>
                  <p>6. If any ſuch thing had beene, or had beene intended by Chriſt to be conferred vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> he had, vpon this, iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to haue decided the Controuerſie: as ſurely he would haue done in <hi>Peters</hi> behalfe, in a matter of ſo great conſequence, as our Aduerſaries make it, as he did in the behalfe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> to appeaſe the contention againſt them, Num. 16. &amp; 17. 10. But Chriſt telleth them all, that no ſuch thing ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in this text, and giueth the reſt authoritie to pull downe the ſpirit of him that would ſeeke to be Chiefe, to make him as a Seruant; as is euident in the words of the text. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is nothing for any authoritie in <hi>Peter:</hi> Nor indeed in any other Scripture.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. The words are a promiſe touching the Churches ſafety, and nothing of <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacie.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It ſpeakes of a Rocke, on which the Church is builded. Now the words are a Metaphor, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> granteth. But a<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de. PP. Rom. cap. 11.</note> Metaphor is to be interpreted, according to the nature of the thing, of which it is ſpoken: as here, of a Rocke, as of a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is to vphold that which is built vpon it, and not to rule ouer that which is builded thereupon. So that from the name of <hi>Rocke,</hi> cannot be concluded Headſhip and Rule, for it is not proper to a foundation, in that reſpect, to rule; but to ſupport and beare vp.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:1814:79"/>III. If Chriſt here, either gaue, or promiſed to giue to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the Headſhip, and that before all the reſt of his Diſciples, Why did then afterward <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> Mar. 10. 35. and their Mother, Math. 20. 2. ſeeke for the chiefeſt places aboue the reſt? Yea, and why did the Apoſtles afterwards ſtriue which of them ſhould be the greateſt, Luk. 22. 24? And why had not Chriſt plainely decided this for <hi>Peter</hi> then, and told them of this his ſpeech and meaning in this place towards <hi>Peter?</hi> If Chriſt had heere intended it, ſurely, there he had not forbidden Soueraignty; but vpon ſo ſit occaſion offered, had ſtabliſhed Headſhip vpon <hi>Peter.</hi> It is cleare therefore, that Chriſt here meant no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. If by Rocke be concluded Headſhip (not to vrge the Metaphor againſt it,) yet <hi>Peter</hi> is neuer the nearer his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for he is not the Rocke.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The name, <hi>Peter,</hi> giueth it him not. For firſt, there Chriſt names him for more vehement affirming of that, which hee<note place="margin">The like ſpeech, Gen. 41. 44.</note> would vtter for the Churches comfort. As if he had ſaid, <hi>As ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as thou art</hi> Peter, and ſo to be called, Ioh. 1. 42. Mar. 3. 16. ſo certainly will I build my Church firmely vpon the Rocke, which thou haſt made confeſſion of, that Hell gates ſhall not preuaile againſt it. So that Chriſt cals him not <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe he ſhould be the Rocke; but that vpon the remembrance of his name, he might thinke vpon the Churches ſafe ſtabilitie (as vpon a Rocke,) againſt all the powers of darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Petros</hi> is the interpretation of <hi>Cephas,</hi> Ioh. 1. 42. and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being by Chriſt, (who ſpake Syriak) called <hi>Cephas,</hi> as he is ſometime ſo named by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. 15.) moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he was called <hi>Peter,</hi> not alluding to <hi>Peter</hi> in this place of <hi>Matthew;</hi> but for that <hi>Cephas</hi> was Syriak, and <hi>Petros</hi> Greeke, and ſo was he named <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe of the generalitie of the Greeke tongue, rather then <hi>Cephas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Petros</hi> ſignifieth in Greeke generally, a ſtone, and not a Rocke of foundation. And therefore though hee be called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> yet is he not therefore the Rocke, but a Stone in the Lords building, a precious ſtone. For the twelue Apoſtles are twelue foundations, Reu. 21. 14. and euery foundation is a precious
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1814:80"/> ſtone, verſe 19. 20. And if <hi>Peter</hi> bee reckoned the firſt in order, he is there a laſper. A ſtone he is, and ſo are all the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles fundamentall ſtones, and likewiſe are the elect ſtones too, 1. Pet. 2. 5. though not ſuch ſtones. But the chiefe corner ſtone is Chriſt, 1. Pet. 2. 6. and here in <hi>Mathew</hi> is hee the Rocke, and not <hi>Peter; Petros</hi> is a ſtone. Now the Church is here built on a Rocke, not on a ſtone, except on the Corner-ſtoue, and on the twelue precious Stones, but not on one ſtone, but vpon one Rocke.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If Chriſt, by calling him <hi>Petros,</hi> had meant him to be <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra:</hi> then had <hi>Petros</hi> bin an appellatiue, the ſame with Rock, and not a proper name, as here it is vſed. For no Demonſtratiue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before it. But if Chriſt had ſaid, Thou art <hi>that Petros,</hi> and vpon that Rock will I build my Church, and ſo made the word appellatiue, this Text had been ſomewhat to the purpoſe: but here is no ſuch Demonſtratiue, <hi>Petros</hi> being a proper name.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He cannot be the Rocke, becauſe that Chriſt cals him <hi>Peter:</hi> for he was <hi>Peter</hi> before, Mar. 3. 16. and is now <hi>Peter,</hi> when Chriſt called him ſo; for he ſaith, Thou art <hi>Peter.</hi> He was not now at this time the Rocke, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth confeſſe.<note place="margin">

                  <p>II. Theſe words, <hi>vpon this Rocke,</hi> will not make <hi>Peter</hi> the Rocke. 1. The Scripture no where makes man the Rocke of Gods Church. <hi>Dauid</hi> called God his Rocke, 2. Sam. 22. 2, 32. Pſal. 18. 2. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Chriſt is the Rocke, 1. Cor. 10. 4. 2. The word <hi>Peter</hi> and Rocke, in the Originall, yea, and in their Tranſlation, are diſtinguiſhed in gender and termination, yea, and in ſignification, as before is noted, and the one a Noune ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatiue, and the other a proper name. 3. The preſent alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpeech from <hi>Peters</hi> perſon, to ſome other thing, will not admit him to be the Rocke. For it is not ſaid (as it in plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpeech ſhould be, if indeed the Rocke had been <hi>Peter,</hi>) Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and vpon thee will I build my Church: but, Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and vpon <hi>this</hi> Rocke, &amp;c. Where the Pronoune <hi>this,</hi> hath Relation to ſome other thing then to <hi>Peter,</hi> euen to his confeſſion, that Ieſus was Chriſt the Sonne of the liuing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1814:80"/> God, vpon which Rocke Chriſt would build his Church. For no where the Scriptures thus vary in a Relatiue, if the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſpeech be to one and the ſame perſon: neither doe any thus vſe to ſpeake, nor may wee thinke that Ieſus Chriſt would haue thus doubtfully ſpoken, if he had purpoſed to haue had <hi>Peter</hi> held to be the Rocke.</p>
                  <p>III. The words following, <hi>I will build my Church,</hi> remoueth <hi>Peter</hi> from being the Rocke.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Church</hi> here is to be vnderſtood the whole Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant and Triumphant. How can <hi>Peter</hi> be the Rocke on which it is built? Could he be the Rocke of the Church Triumphant, when he was here militant? Or can he be the Rocke now of the Militant, and he a Saint in Heauen Triumphant? Or how the Rocke of both, then and now, as hee that is the Rocke muſt be? For on the Rocke is the Church built, not a part of it, but the whole, and not for a time, but euen for euer. For will all, or any part of the Church once built vpon the Rocke, bee remoued off from the Rocke? Or will the Rocke ceaſe to bee the bearer vp of the Church? Then either is <hi>Peter</hi> now, the Rocke, or he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was the Rocke at all. But how can he now be, whoſe bodie is turned to duſt? Can his Soule be the Rocke? As for a Rocke by ſucceſſion, it is but a fantaſie. Chriſt ſpeakes of an euerlaſting ſuſtaining Rocke, and but of one Rocke, and not of one Rocke after another, dying and decaying.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>this Rocke</hi> are two things: for Chriſt ſaith he will build his Church vpon this Rocke. Now <hi>Peter</hi> was one, in, and of the Church: here, a principall member militant; and now, a Saint triumphant. He muſt therefore bee one, built with the Church, vpon the Rocke: he cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himſelfe be the Rocke; for ſo himſelfe ſhould be built vpon himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt ſpeakes of his <hi>Church,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>my Church.</hi> Had he no Church, but that which was built vpon <hi>Peter?</hi> Had not he at this very time, when he ſpake theſe words, a Church? Was <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Iohn Baptiſt, Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Annah,</hi> the other Apoſtles, the 70. Diſciples, and many others following him, not of his Church? If they were,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1814:81"/> were they built on <hi>Peter?</hi> Did they know <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Rock? Or were they of the Church, &amp; not built as yet vpon the Rock? For as yet <hi>Peter</hi> was not the Rocke, by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſt here made himſelfe a Builder; I will build (ſaith he) my Church. He built while he did liue, by his Word and Spirit. But did his Word and Spirit gather any to <hi>Peter?</hi> Did his Word and Spirit build his followers vpon <hi>Peter?</hi> Chriſt built his Church by his Apoſtles: for they are ſaid to build: and <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelfe, as of a wiſe Maſter-builder, 1. Cor. 3. 10. But vpon what did they build? Euen vpon Chriſt alone, 1. Cor. 3. 11. Epheſ. 2. 20. in whom all the building is knit together, verſe 21. They built not vpon <hi>Peter;</hi> nor he on himſelfe, but vpon Chriſt, 1. Pet. 2. 4, 5, 6. Did any of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preach <hi>Peter? Paul</hi> ſaith, he preached not men, but God, Gal. 1. 10. Or did <hi>Peter</hi> preach himſelfe to be the Rocke? If he was the Rocke, why did they not preach him? If they did not, who can beleeue it?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, if <hi>Peter</hi> now was made the Rock, and Head, as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Turrecremata,</hi> and many other Papiſts auerre, though <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſaith it was but here promiſed; how came this Rocke, by and by after in <hi>Mathew,</hi> to be called Satan, Mat. 16. 23? Is it like that Chriſt would call the Rock, on which he will ſo firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly build his Church, Satan? Laſtly, if it were granted, that Chriſt built his Church on <hi>Peter;</hi> yet is it not ſpoken exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely, as on him alone, ſecluding the reſt of the Apoſtles; for elſewhere he conioynes them with him, Ioh. 23. 23. Epheſ. 20. 20. Reu. 21. 14. Mat. 28. 19.</p>
                  <p>IV. Theſe words, <hi>and the gates of Hell ſhall not preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it,</hi> will ouerthrow <hi>Peters</hi> being the Rocke. For this Rock beareth vp ſo powerfully the Church, that Hell gates ſhall not preuaile againſt it. Whence followeth, that this Rocke muſt needs be ſtronger then Satans power and policies. But what power can that be, but the power of Chriſt, and of God? For who but God can reſiſt Hell gates? Therefore from all the words of this Text it is cleare, that <hi>Peter</hi> cannot by it bee the Head of the Church, nor the Rocke on which it is built: and yet this place is one of the chiefeſt for his Headſhip.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1814:81"/>
                  <p>The words in the next verſe 19. <hi>I will giue thee the Keyes,</hi> are anſwered before.</p>
                  <p>Ioh. 21. 15, 17. <hi>Ieſus ſaid to</hi> Simon Peter, Simon, <hi>ſonne of Ionas, loueſt thou me more then theſe? Feed my Lambes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here are no expreſſe words of Headſhip, neither can any ſuch thing be concluded out of this place, by any well framed argument: and yet this is the very principall place which they alledge to vphold it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt here calleth him not <hi>Peter,</hi> (for that name is vttered by the Euangeliſt,) but onely <hi>Simon the ſonne of</hi> Ionas, as thereby preuenting the conceit of Headſhip, which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries dreame of from the name of <hi>Peter.</hi> Which our Sauiour here mentioneth not, nor the name <hi>Cephas,</hi> becauſe of his fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deniall of him ſo lately, as now therefore vnworthy of that name.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he is here queſtioned concerning his loue, which he ſo much boaſted of before Chriſts taking, and ſoone after ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue loſt, by forſwearing Chriſt. And three times hee is asked, to remember him of his three times deniall of Chriſt, it being now alſo the third time of Chriſts appearing to them, verſe 14. Alſo the queſtion is with a compariſon, <hi>Loueſt thou me more then theſe?</hi> What if hee meant it of the 153. great Fiſhes, with the Ship, Nets, and other things therein? for he leaped into the Sea, hearing of Chriſt, and caſt off all reſpect to the ſhip and Fiſhes, verſe 7. till Chriſt willed them to bring of the fiſhes, ver. 10. 11. And therefore might Chriſt demand thereupon this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: neither is any thing in the Text againſt this. For Chriſt was by the fiſhes, and the queſtion was after dinner. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it of the reſt of the Apoſtles, as it is commonly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; for <hi>Peter</hi> had preferred his owne loue before all of them before, Mat. 26. 33. Luk. 22. 23. Which here Chriſt, by thus propounding the queſtion, remembers him of, as a check to his former conceitedneſſe, ſeeing his loue appeared leſſe then theirs. Chriſt here queſtions <hi>Peters</hi> loue, hee here in a ſort checks his former boaſting. What of all this? <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee is the Head of the Church, and Prince of Paſtors. Logically concluded!</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Peters</hi> anſwer was now affirmatiue, concerning
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1814:82"/> his loue ſimply. He durſt not boaſt now comparatiuely, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Neither did he anſwer to the compariſon, but appealed to Chriſts knowledge of his loue towards him. And therefore at the other two times, Chriſt leaueth out the compariſon. Which ſhewes that <hi>Peter</hi> knew his former folly, and now diſcerned no ſuperioritie of loue in himſelfe aboue the reſt; neither that Chriſt purpoſed to commend it aboue the loue of the other, and ſo to preferie him aboue them, but to make <hi>Peter</hi> more humble, and better to know himſelfe, as the whole carriage of the buſineſſe ſheweth.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the words, <hi>Feede my Lambes,</hi> will not afford <hi>Peter</hi> any Headſhip.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. In generall, this charge was as to re-inſtall him againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Apoſtleſhip, that it might not bee doubted of, and that by a threefold command. Firſt, becauſe of a threefold deniall of Chriſt, by which hee had deſerued to loſe his Apoſtleſhip. And ſecondly, for that Chriſt would haue him very diligently carefull in performing the charge of feeding: being thus merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully admitted into the grace of the Apoſtleſhip againe, but not aduanced into any <hi>higher dignitie</hi> and command ouer other Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Againe, this charge followeth not as a reward of his loue, which had formerly ſo failed: but as a true declaration of his loue now againe profeſſed towards Chriſt. For what great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of loue had it been to Chriſt, for <hi>Peter</hi> to haue accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a Supremacie aboue all the reſt, which before they had fooliſhly contended for? Luk. 22. 24.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The word <hi>feede</hi> maketh not heere for any Headſhip.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, it was a duty of his Office already receiued, for an Apoſtle to feed, and not an impoſing of a new Dignitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a common charge to all the Apoſtles, Mat. 28. 19. Mar. 16. 15. Yea, to other Biſhops and Elders, Act. 20. 28. 1. Pet. 5. 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the words in the Greeke, which Chriſt vſeth here,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1814:82"/> feeding from other of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the word in our Engliſh <hi>to feede,</hi> and the Greeke<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> words, are taken from ſuch as feed beaſts of the earth. The one is vſed for ſuch as keepe Swine. Mat. 8. 34. Mar. 5. 14. but this<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> our Aduerſaries make no vſe of, to pearke vp <hi>Peters</hi> regencie. And yet Chriſt in the Euangeliſts language vſeth this word twice, in the firſt queſtion, and in the laſt verſes 15. 17. and the<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> other word but once; perhaps becauſe of ſuch as are fed, that is, outwardly called, there will bee two Swine or Goats, for one true Sheepe. This laſt word is taken from Shepheards, feeding their flockes; as the word here applyed to Lambes doth ſhew. So in 1. Cor. 9. 7. 1. Pet. 5. 2. This they take great hold on, to helpe forward their conceit. Becauſe this word is applyed not onely to Teachers, as in this place, and in Act. 20. 28. 1. Pet. 5. 2. and the word Paſtor alſo, taken from Shepheards, applyed to Teachers, Mat. 9. 36. and 26. 31. but the ſame is ſpoken alſo of Kings, Math. 2. 6. Reuel. 19. 15. So it is to teach, and to beare rule ouer others. Therefore they will hence conclude, that <hi>Peter</hi> had heere a Princely Supremacie beſtowed vpon him.</p>
                  <p>But firſt the word which is vſed twice, both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> doth limit the ſignification of this, which is but once vſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a word of double ſignification is to be vnderſtood according to the ſubiect matter ſpoken of: and that ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken, which is fitteſt to the thing in hand.</p>
                  <p>As this word, here tranſlated <hi>feede,</hi> ſpoken of a King, is to<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> gouerne and rule, as a King, and not to teach as a Paſtor. But being ſpoken of a ſpirituall Paſtor, as here it is, it cannot bee ſo meant of ruling as a King: but is to be vnderſtood of feeding, as a ſpirituall Paſtor, by Doctrine and life, and not of ruling. Or if of ruling too, yet it is but of ſuch a rule as befitteth a Paſtor, and not of the Rule which is in a King. For our Aduerſaries can no more conclude from the double ſignification of the word, that <hi>Peter</hi> is to teach, as an Apoſtle and Biſhop, and to rula alſo as a King, the Church: then it may bee concluded of a King, that he is not onely to rule as a King, but alſo to teach the Church as a Biſhop. This they will not allow to Kings, whom
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1814:83"/> they hold Lay-men: and yet the Argument from the double ſignification, is as good for the one, as for the other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our Sauiour Chriſt tooke on himſelfe no ſuch Rule, as they would giue vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> to lay it vpon their proud Pope. Though the name of Gouernour be giuen to Chriſt, as of rule and power alſo, Mat. 2. 6. and 28. 18. yet he would not be made a King, Ioh. 6. 15. though he was a King, Ioh. 1. 49. nor would meddle in diuiding the inheritance, Luk. 12. nor allow Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty in his Diſciples, Luke 22. 24, 25, 26. Muſt here then a word of double ſignification bee written aduantageouſly to lift vp <hi>Peter</hi> to a new Dignity, which Chriſt neuer allowed of in them, nor euer tooke vpon himſelfe, as the Pope doth? As his Father ſent him, Iohn 20. ſo ſent he not <hi>Peter</hi> onely, but them, that is, all the reſt of the Apoſtles. But that was not to beare rule ouer Nations in outward State, as the Pope doth, as much as hee can: but to teach and preach to all the world: this did Chriſt. And his ſeruants may not thinke to be aboue their Maſter, or to be ſent from him, otherwiſe then his Father ſent him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who exhorteth the Elders to <hi>feede,</hi> vſeth the ſame word, in 1. Pet. 5. 2. that is here in this Text; and yet by and by forbids them to be Lords ouer Gods Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. If this word had noted any ſuch ſoueraignty, hee would not haue giuen it to Inferiours; nor haue immediately forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Dominion thereupon, if there had beene any ſuch Rule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: for that had beene to giue, and by and by to take away againe.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the word and Title of <hi>Paſtor,</hi> whence the other word<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>to feede</hi> commeth, is the fourth degree vnder an Apoſtle: for Apoſtles, Prophets, and Euangeliſts are before Paſtors. Now, a Paſtor, or Biſhop, or Elder, is to feede, Acts 20. 28. 1. Pet. 5. 2. Therefore here is not impoſed a Superioritie vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> but a Dutie common to other of inferiour ranke. This word <hi>feede</hi> therefore will helpe them nothing for the Supremacie.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>my,</hi> pulleth downe <hi>Peter</hi> from Soueraignty. For firſt, <hi>Peters</hi> charge is to ſeed, not his owne, but Chriſts ſheepe. So then, <hi>Peter</hi> is not a Lord, but a Seruant-Shepheard, to feede
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1814:83"/> the chiefe Shepheards flocke, as <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe calleth Chriſt, who knew no other chiefe Shepheardſhip, either in himſelfe, or in any other, but in Chriſt, 1. Pet. 5. 3. And wee reade how the flocke is called Gods, Act. 20. 28. 1. Pet. 5. 2. but no where <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> As alſo by Chriſt himſelfe wee are taught, that there is but one fold, and one Shepheard of that fold, to wit, but one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Shepheard, and that is he himſelfe, Ioh. 10. 11, 14, 16. and not <hi>Peter,</hi> and that by <hi>Peters</hi> owne acknowledgement in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted place, 1. Pet. 5. 3.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Lambes,</hi> or <hi>Sheepe</hi> conſidered with the reſt of the words, and as it is commonly taken, wipes away <hi>Peters</hi> Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, the words are not ſpoken vniuerſally, <hi>Feede all my Lambes,</hi> as if hee had been charged with <hi>all</hi> of them. For this had beene a charge: Firſt, which hee could neuer haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſecondly, which he neuer did attempt to performe. Now, God neuer impoſed any impoſſible charge vpon him; and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> would not haue been found faithleſſe. But it is ſpoken inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, to feed here, and there, whom he could, and where hee could, at any time. Therefore hee is not here the vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Lambes</hi> or <hi>Sheepe</hi> are not Apoſtles, Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts, and Paſtors. Theſe are neuer ſo called, but in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Ieſus Chriſt onely, Mat. 26. 31. and neuer in reference to any man. But if vnder theſe Lambes and Sheepe bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all, and euery one of the Church and flocke of Chriſt, then by their account, all the Apoſtles, and the reſt, muſt bee ſheepe, and <hi>Peter</hi> their Shepheard, and ſo a Shepheard ouer ſhepheards. Which vaine conceit, without proofe, who can giue credit vnto? And yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Lambes and Sheepe. The Lambes forſooth, muſt bee the Laitie; and the Sheepe, the Apoſtles: when as the words are vſed indifferently, Math. 10. 16. Luk. 10. 3. Act. 8. 32. And<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> Chriſt, though he vſe two words, yet doth not make any ſuch difference. For the two words <hi>to feede,</hi> are applyed alſo indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to either of them. So that taking ſheepe for the Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> muſt not onely rule as they would haue it, but alſo teach
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1814:84"/> the Apoſtles: when Apoſtles are all immediately from Chriſt, and taught of Chriſt, and by his holy Spirit, Galat. 1. 1, 12. and needed no inſtruction from man in the worke of the Miniſterie, Math. 10. 20. Ioh. 14. 26. and 16. 13. Thus we ſee, there is not the leaſt footing in any word of this Text, for <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacie aboue all other, on which yet they ſettle it. But if here <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacie could bee proued, yet whats this to the Pope? He feeds not by preaching Chriſts Lambes: but rules, or rather rauages like a roaring Lyon, ouer Chriſts Sheepe: hee is like a Lambe, but ſpeakes like the Dragon, Reuel. 13.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that here is no Headſhip giuen to <hi>Peter,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in verſe 17. where it is ſaid, that, vpon Chriſts third time queſtioning him, he was grieued. Now, may wee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſe, if <hi>Peter</hi> had conceiued of Chriſts words, as Popes doe, that a Supremacie was therein beſtowed vpon him, that hee would haue beene grieued? Doe men grieue at high preferments offered, eſpecially hauing contended for the ſame, as the Apoſtles had done? Who ſeeth not therefore, that <hi>Peter</hi> perceiued no ſuch glorious preferment, nor high Dignitie, out of any thing that Chriſt here ſpoke, as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries doe? From all this it is cleere, that <hi>Peter</hi> from hence hath no Headſhip aboue others.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1814:84"/> bodily abſence, which was his holy Spirit, Ioh. 15. 26. &amp; 16. 7.

                  <p>Secondly, it telleth vs, that according to this promiſe, when Chriſt aſcended, hee ſent downe his Spirit, Act. 2. by which Gods people are ſtill guided and taught, Rom. 8. 1, 5, 9. 11, 14, 26. 1. Cor. 2. 10, 12. 1. Ioh. 2. 20, 27. which beareth witneſſe to our ſpirits, that wee are Gods children, Rom. 8. 16. Gal. 4. 6. by which wee are ſealed to eternall life, 2. Cor. 1. 12. Epheſ. 1. 13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it declareth vnto vs, that when Chriſt aſcended, hee was mindfull of his Church, and gaue gifts vnto men: Some, to<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 12.</note> be Apoſtles; ſome, Prophets; ſome, Euangeliſts; ſome, Paſtors, and Teachers: but among theſe, no one generall Vicar, or Head ouer all.

For that they were the conſummation of the Saints. 2. For the worke of the Miniſterie. 3. For the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now, if a generall viſible Vicar on earth had ſerued for any of theſe purpoſes, hee had been giuen of Chriſt: but he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not, and therefore this needleſſe gift was not giuen to any.</p>
                  <p>As for a ſupply of Inſtructers, Guides, and Lights in the Church Militant, wee deny not, but Chriſt hath left many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars, and doth ſtill ſend dayly Embaſſadours to his Church, to reconcile vs to God. And ſo our Biſhops, and other Miniſters of the Church, by the Keyes of power and knowledge, open the way of Heauen to Chriſtian people, which they doe in Chriſts ſtead, and therein are his Vicars, or Deputies, lawfully called.

                     <hi>Tolet. in Ioh.</hi> 20. 21. ſaith, that Chriſt inſtituted his <hi>Apoſtles, his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icars.</hi> How then was <hi>Peter</hi> his Vicar? for their cannot be a Vicars Vicar. If <hi>Peter</hi> was then the Vicar of Chriſt, they could not be Vicars too; and, by theſe mens teſtimonie, they being Vicars, he was not Chriſts onely Vicar.</p>
                  <p>Now then I conclude, that if <hi>Peter</hi> was not the Prince of the Apoſtles, nor the Head of the Church, nor Chriſts onely gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Vicar here on earth, then the Pope cannot poſſibly bee any of theſe. For he claimeth all from <hi>Peter,</hi> as being his onely ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> neuer hauing theſe from Chriſt, as is fully proued, the Pope cannot haue them.

That <hi>Peter</hi> was euer (after he was Chriſts<note place="margin">See my Booke: The fabulous foundation of the Popedome</note> Diſciple) perſonally at Rome. 2. That albeit hee had beene at Rome, therefore (already being an Apoſtle) hee was the Biſhop of Rome, an inferiour Dignitie. 3. That whatſoeuer was giuen to <hi>Peter,</hi> the ſame was alſo giuen to the Pope, ſucceſſiuely to the worlds end. 4. That the Pope is truely <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, both in Doctrine, and life. 5.

                  <head>Confuted by their owne Bible.</head>
                  <p>1. IT doth forbid them, Deut. 4. 23. where is forbidden the making of a grauen ſimilitude: which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith is a forgetting of the Couenant. And in verſe 15. hee ſaith, You ſaw no ſimilitude in that day. And a reaſon is giuen, Leſt perhaps deceiued, you might make you a grauen ſimilitude, or Image. Here the drawing of any ſimilitude of God is vtterly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So in Rom. 1. 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 4. Thou ſhalt not make to thee a grauen thing, nor any ſimilitude, &amp;c. thou ſhalt not adore them, nor ſerue them.</p>
                  <p>Here is not onely a grauen thing, but any ſimilitude forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, without any reſtriction, or exception at all, and alſo the adoration of them. And a reaſon is in Eſay 42. 8. I will not giue my glory to another, nor my praiſe to grauen things: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can God be likened to any thing, or an Image be made of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1814:88"/> him, Eſay 14. 18. &amp; 46. 5. Act. 17. 29. Wiſd. 14. 17. This commandement condemneth in matter of Religion, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our owne heads a grauen thing, and any likeneſſe, not onely of things which be not (which they ſay are Idols, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of things which are not, falſe Similitudes,) but a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thing, and ſimilitude of any thing which is in heauen, which is in earth, and of things which are in the waters, to adore and ſerue them, Leu. 26. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, their Bible layeth folly to their charge, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that ſuch are vaine in their cogitations, and their fabliſh heart darkened, who make God in ſimilitude of a man, Rom. 1. 21, 22, 23. This hath God fearefully puniſhed, and that with a ſpirituall plague, Rom. 1. 26. Hee is pronounced accurſed, that makes a grauen and molten thing, an abomination to our Lord, the worke of the hands of Artificers, and puts it in ſecret (how much more openly?) to worſhip it; and all the people are to ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> Let them be confounded, (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore ſculptils, Pſal. 96. 7. The Iewes to this day, hate Images: which ſhewes, that they were taught by the Law to hate them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by their Bible we learne, that this was an Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh practice. The Heathen inuented this making of Images of the dead, Wiſd. 14. 15. They decked them, lighted Candles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, offered to them, Baruch 6. and worſhipped them, Wiſd. 14. 17, 18. and their Prieſts were ſhauen, and beguiled the people Baruch 6. as the ſhauen Prieſts of Rome doe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, their owne Bible telleth, that no good commeth thereof, but euill, Hab. 2. 18, 19. <hi>What profiteth the thing engrauen, that the forger thereof hath grauen it a molten and a falſe Image? What canit teach?</hi> Hee telleth vs, that an Image cannot teach. The <hi>Doctrine of their vanity is wood,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ieremie,</hi> chap. 10. 8. <hi>and euery Craftsman confounded in his ſculptill, becauſe it is falſe, which hee hath melted, and there is no ſpirit in them. They are vaine things, and a worke worthy to be laughed at,</hi> verſe 14. 15. It is changing the verity of God, into lying, Rom. 1. 25. For the ſhadow of a Picture, is a labour without fruit, the louers of euill, are worthy to haue their hopes in ſuch things: both they that make them, and that loue, and that worſhip them,

                  <p>Fiftly, by their Bible wee learne, that men worſhipping the worke of their owne hands, they doe worſhip <hi>idols, Diuels.</hi> 1. Therein we finde Heathen idols, Diuels, 1. Cor. 10. 20. repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of falſe gods. 2. We finde the Iſraelites worſhipping the worke of their owne hands, the golden Calues, falſly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the True God, and theſe calues were <hi>idols,</hi> Act. 7. 41. <hi>and diuels,</hi> 2. Chro. 11. 15. Whereby wee ſee the repreſenting of the True God falſly, is a diuelliſh idol, as well as the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting of a falſe god. 3. We finde <hi>idols,</hi> and ſo the worſhip of <hi>Diuels</hi> among the Papiſts, Reu. 9. 20, 21. where the workes of mens hands, of gold, ſiluer, braſſe, ſtone, and wood, are called <hi>idols,</hi> and <hi>diuels.</hi> But they worſhip the workes of their hands, made of ſuch things; and therefore worſhip idols and diuels. Thus God condemneth Imagerie for idols and diuels. And this very place may fitly be vnderſtood of Papiſts. For firſt theſe ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, here ſpoken of, are ſuch as fall out to bee vnder the ſixt trumpet, long after the deſtruction of the Heathen idolaters. 2. They are ſuch as be after the Starre is fallen, chap. 9. 1. and become a King of the Locuſts. But what Clergie man ſince Chriſt, euer wore a Crowne, but the Pope? 3. They are ſuch, as thoſe great Armies, verſe 16. were raiſed vp to plague, for their idolatry. But what can theſe be, but Turkes, the ſcourge of Popiſh idolaters, &amp; idolatrous Chriſtians? 4. They are ſuch as ouer-ranne the true Religion, ſo as Chriſt ſends out his Word to recouer his from vnder this idolatrie, and from among them, chap. 10. 11. But who haue ſpred their idols ouer the Church? Not Iewes, nor Turkes, but Papiſts. And hath not Chriſt ſent out his Word to regaine his from among them? 5. And laſtly, the words, chap. 9. 20, 21. doe ſet out Papiſts. 1. They repented not of the works of their hands, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſaw the Eaſteme Churches ouerthrowne by the Turkes for their idolatrie, after the ſecond Nicene Councell there eſtabliſhing it. 2. Theſe committed Murthers, Sorceries, Fornication, and Thefts. And doe not all know how theſe raigne among Papiſts? For murders, their maſſacres of Chriſtians, and vnheard of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties vpon poore Indians, many millions witneſſe them. For
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1814:89"/> Sorceries, is not ſpirituall Babylon, that is, Rome, full thereof, chap. 18. 23? Rome now is that Whore, drunke with bloud, chap. 17. which deceiued the Nations by her Sorceries, chap. 18. 23. For her Fornication, ſhe is called the Mother of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, chap. 17. And doe not her Stewes witneſſe it? What ſhall I ſpeake, how vnder colour of vowed pouertie, by Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, Pardons, Indulgences, ſhee robbed euery Kingdome? Therefore theſe are Papiſts, worſhipping idols, and diuels, and cannot ſo well bee applyed to any other vnder heauen, all the former circumſtances ſeriouſly and throughly weighed. See B. <hi>Carleton</hi> his Booke of Thanksgiuing, how he preſſeth this text vpon Papiſts.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, this was made, not to be worſhipped, but to bee a typicall and operatiue ſigne, as the euent teacheth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this had a miraculous effect by Gods diuine power; a promiſe annexed to it of life, to euery one bitten, that looked vpon it, Numb. 21. 9. being a liuely type of Chriſt, Ioh. 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this was abroad in the Campe; ſet on a pole, not in the Tabernacle. What is this to Images in the Churches?</p>

                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2. King. 18. 4. did, among other defacings of Idolatries, breake in pieces this Brazen Serpent: for that the people burnt incenſe to it. And the vſe being paſt, and a foule abuſe crept in, in contempt he called it Nehuſhtan, a piece of braſſe.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We approue of the Art, and the vſe thereof to the right end, as of God: and that to make ſuch Images as God commanded them, to be in the Tabernacle.

                  <p>Gen. 28. 13. Exo. 33. Eſa. 6. Amos 9. Dan. 7. All theſe places ſhew how God appeared: and there is aſcribed to him eyes, hands, and face; and therefore may God be pictured.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Agrippa</hi> told <hi>Caligula,</hi> that the Temple neuer admitted any Image made with hands, and ſaid farther, Our forefathers haue holden it a thing vnlawfull, to paint or carue him that is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. <hi>Philo.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Durand</hi> calleth it a foolery (hee might better haue ſaid, an horrible impietie,) to make or adore an Image of the Trinitie, in 3. <hi>diſt. 9. q.</hi> 2. Many Papiſts hold it vnlawfull to paint the holy Trinitie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caietan, Catharinus, Diegus, Abulenſis, Pereſius,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if God may be ſo pictured, as hee by apparitions or words ſets himſelfe forth; we ſhould haue repreſented to our ſenſes, a very abominable Idol, in ſuch varietie of parts and faſhions, as it ſhould be a very Idolatrous Monſter; a picture of that which is not, which they themſelues ſay is an Idol, and ſo forbidden.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, howſoeuer God did appeare: yet was he neuer ſeene, Ioh. 1. 18. 1. Tim. 6. 16. <hi>Moſes</hi> could not ſee his face, and liue, Exod. 33. 20. For Gods ſpeaking to him face to face, is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a familiar manner, as a man ſpeaketh to his friend, as is there in the Text. How can hee be truely pictured that neuer was ſeene, nor can be ſeene?</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, though he might be pictured as he appeared: yet the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1814:92"/> popiſh picture is an abominable idol: for no where euer appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he like an old ſide-bearded man, with three crownes, yea, and ſometime with three faces, ſitting on a fear, with his Sonne before him, and a Doue ouer his head. This childiſh baby, or rather Idol, is their owne inuention.</p>

                  <p>For firſt, the Arke was of Gods own appointment to be made for manner, matter, and end, Exod. 25. 9. but ſo bee not their Images.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Arke is called his footſtoole. But Images are not ſo called: neither claimeth he them for his.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God promiſed his preſence with the Arke, Exod. 25. 22. But where is his promiſe to be with their Images?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Arke was not an Image. What is this then to an Image?</p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:1814:92"/>
                  <p>Fiftly, the Arke was in the moſt holy place, into which none could enter but the High Prieſts. Therefore the people could not adore it, but a farre off, as being in the out-Court, without any ſight thereof. Now, their Images are neere, and in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples view; and not only where the High Prieſt of Rome comes. If they will haue Images, as the Arke, then let his High Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip keepe them in his moſt holy Chappell for himſelfe, and let them be for him only, as the moſt Holy was for the high Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, by the Arkes being in ſo remote a place, its cleere, that the words muſt be tranſlated, <hi>Adore yee towards his footſtoele,</hi> as in 1. King. 8. 44. <hi>Pray towards the holy Citie, and the houſe which hee had choſen.</hi> And then the Arke was not adored, but God, it being the ſigne of Gods preſence, before which they worſhipped, 1. Sam. 1. 19.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, if it was worſhipped becauſe of the Images vpon it, then was it only worſhipped in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi> For there the Cherubims were ſpred ouer it, and not elſewhere; and then onely the High Prieſt adored it: for he onely ſaw the Images ouer it. And then this Text ſeemeth to ſpeake, not to all, but to him. What is this to the peoples worſhipping of Images?</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, and laſtly, it is vntrue, to ſay the Iewes worſhipped it, becauſe of the Images on it. For firſt, they neither did, nor could euer ſee any Image vpon it. Secondly, wee reade of the Arke, brought forth; in their iourneyings in the wilderneſſe; ſo in going ouer Iordan; alſo into the Campe of Iſrael, 1. Sam. 4. 5. and at other times: but wee neuer read of any that did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it. But if this had beene a commandement here, ſurely there would haue beene ſome example of adoring it. Thirdly, they were commanded to worſhip God, Deut. 6. 13. &amp; 10. 20. but no where to worſhip any other thing. Fourthly, how could it be, that they worſhipped the Arke, becauſe of the Images vpon it; when the angels, which by the Images were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, were not adored of them? Would they worſhip the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and not the things themſelues? For as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, No<note place="margin">Contr.

                  <hi>XXIII. Propoſition.</hi> That the Lords Supper is to be adminiſtred to the people in one kinde onely:</head>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Confuted by their owne Bible.</head>
                  <p>1. IT teacheth vs, that Chriſt, inſtituting this his laſt Supper, adminiſtred it in both kinds: giuing a commandement to take and eate, and alſo to drinke, Mat. 26. 26, 27. Luk. 20. 20.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> repeating the inſtitution, mentioneth both the Bread, and the Chalice, 1. Cor. 11. 24, 25. And firſt he tels them, that this hee receiued of the Lord. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he deliuered the ſame vnto them, verſe 23. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he, in verſe 28. plainely preſcribeth the <hi>eating of the Bread, and drinking of the Chalice;</hi> and that to euery one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth prepared, and proueth himſelfe, ſaying, Let him <hi>eate</hi> of that bread, and <hi>drinke</hi> of that Chalice. Out of which place it is euident, that the drinking of the Chalice is of equall extent with the duty of prouing our ſelues, before wee come vnto this Sacrament. But the duty is generall and belongeth vnto all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently. The drinking of the Chalice therefore may not be denied vnto any.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Church then in his dayes did receiue it in both kindes, 1. Cor. 11. 26. For it is ſaid there, <hi>So often as you ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this Chalice, you ſhall ſhew the death of our Lord vntill hee come.</hi> By both they ſhew his death. And this
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1814:93"/> place ſhews clearely that ſo often as they receiued, they did eate the Bread, and drinke the Chalice.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt did admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in both. For the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Cor. 10. 16. <hi>The Chalice of benediction, which we doe bleſſe, is it not the communication of the bloud of Chriſt? and the bread which wee breake, is it not the participation of the body of the Lord?</hi> Here the Apoſtle firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth both the Chalice and Bread. Secondly, by the word <hi>we,</hi> he vnderſtands himſelfe and other, which did bleſſe the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and breake the Bread. Thirdly, he ſaith, that by the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice we communicate of Chriſts bloud; and by the bread, wee participate of his bodie: and not by one of them, of them both. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would haue Chriſts bloud out of his bodie in the<note place="margin">Againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy. See D. <hi>White</hi> his laſt booke, <hi>pag. 460, 466.</hi>
                     </note> Chalice repreſented, and not by the bread onely both his body and bloud. Fourthly, Chriſt is perfect food: wee muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eate him, and drinke him. Drinke alone preſerues not life, nor onely to eate; but both to eate and drinke; therefore Chriſt inſtituted both to be receiued. If the Aduerſaries ſay that this receiuing was of the Apoſtles, and as they by conſequent would<note place="margin">See an anſwer to this there alſo. <hi>pag. 488, 489, 492.</hi>
                     </note> inferre of Prieſts onely, which may receiue in both kindes, but not the Laitie:</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt that the Apoſtles, receiuing the Sacrament from Chriſt, were then and there for the whole Church. They recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued alone, becauſe they were Chriſts family, to receiue together the Paſſeouer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Apoſtles were not as yet fully ordained, till Chriſt breathed on them after his Reſurrection, Ioh. 20. 21. as ſome euen of Papiſts affirme.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if, becauſe they onely were preſent at the inſtitution, they therefore ſhould onely receiue in both kinds: then what warrant haue they to admit any, but Prieſts, to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? What warrant to admit women to it, ſo much as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the bread? Yea, why are any Lay-men admitted to the bread, or to the Sacrament at all? for no Lay perſons did receiue with the Apoſtles, no not Chriſts Mother.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, touching the 1. Cor. 10. 16. there is (vnder the word <hi>we</hi>) meant the Apoſtles, and other Miniſters of the Word
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1814:94"/> and Sacraments, that they bleſſed and brake, that is, conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and adminiſtred the Lords Supper vnto other, to wit, the Laitie. For in verſe 21. he plainly ſheweth how the Corinthians did drinke of the Chalice, and did partake of the Table of the Lord, though they could not receiue worthily ſo doing, if they went vnto the Idol Temples. Thus are they confuted by their owne Bible.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is not ſpoken of the Sacrament. For firſt, Chriſt<note place="margin">So hold many Papiſts, Doctor <hi>White, pag 495</hi>
                     </note> had not as yet inſtituted it. Secondly, he ſpeaketh of ſpirituall bread, then preſent, <hi>I am the liuing Bread,</hi> in the former part of the verſe: to which the relation is in theſe words here, <hi>This bread,</hi> to wit, himſelfe, the <hi>liuing Bread; I am the bread of life,</hi> ſaith he, verſe 48. The Sacramentall bread was not as yet, when thus he ſpake. Thirdly, the bread here was that, which (when he ſpake) came downe from heauen, verſe 50. 58. But the bread which Chriſt adminiſtred at his laſt Supper, neuer came from heauen. Fourthly, this bread whoſo eateth, maketh him that eateth it, to liue for euer: but ſo doth not the Sacramental bread which may be eaten by the wicked. Fiftly, he himſelfe expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth what he meaneth by <hi>this Bread,</hi> euen his <hi>owne fleſh,</hi> which he giueth for the life of the world, and which he did giue vpon the Croſſe. But the Sacramentall bread is not his owne fleſh. As for that errour of tranſubſtantiation, the vanitie of it ſhall be confuted in the next queſtion. Sixtly, if this bee ſpoken of the Sacrament, then all that receiue it not, haue no life in them, verſe 53. as Infants, and other, before they come to ripe age: which they will not affirme. And yet will it vndeniably follow, if this be properly meant of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>II. If it were granted, that Chriſt ſpake here of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1814:95"/> which hee would inſtitute: yet this place helpeth not our Aduerſaries, but rather maketh hue and cry after their the euery, for preſuming to rob the people of the Cup. For firſt, in verſ. 53. Chriſt plainely ſaith, <hi>Vnleſſe yee eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you ſhall not haue life in you.</hi> And in verſe 54. he ſaith, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, hath euerlaſting life.</hi> So he bindeth life to both, and ſecludeth life from ſuch as receiue not both. Secondly, therefore both being ſo neceſſarie, it followeth, that when he onely mentioneth the eating of bread, there is a figure, one part for both. Elſe ſhould the diuine Oracles of our Sauiour thwart one the other, in preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing both eating and drinking, <hi>affirmatiuely,</hi> to the obtaining of life, in receiuing both; and <hi>negatiuely,</hi> to loſſe of life, in not receiuing both. Thirdly, Chriſt goeth about to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ſufficient food for the life of his, which beleeue in him. Now, a man cannot liue by onely eating, nor onely drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but by both. Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drinke indeed,</hi> verſe 55. He ſaith not, <hi>that his fleſh is both meate and drinke.</hi> He knew that his body had fleſh and bloud: yet he willeth to eate, and drinke. Now, the fleſh is to be eaten, and the bloud to be drunke. In eating his fleſh, wee cannot be ſaid to drinke his bloud. For that which is to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, cannot bee ſaid to bee drunken too; theſe being two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and differing actions, for two things. If one would haue ſerued, the vrging of two had beene needleſſe. Fourthly and laſtly, hee mentioneth Bread, not to exclude Wine; and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not to exclude drinking: but becauſe hee had ſpoken of Manna, the Iſraelites bread in the Wilderneſſe, and ſo called himſelfe Bread, keeping the ſubiect and occaſion of which hee had begun to ſpeake. So in Ioh. 4. ſpeaking with the Woman of Samaria, occaſioned by the drawing of water out of the Well, hee promiſeth to giue her water to drinke. Would any therefore hence conclude, that onely water were ſufficient, and no need of eating bread? As we cannot conclude ſo, from the one, no more can we from the other.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 24. 30, 35. <hi>He tooke bread, bleſſed, and brake, and did reach to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:1814:95"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is not meant of adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Chriſt once did inſtitute and adminiſter it, but no more for ought wee finde. For note here: firſt, that the two Diſciples went into a common Inne, to take their ordinary food, at night, where they meant to haue lodged; they met not together for the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it was in the night time, no neceſſitie vrging for the Sacrament. The Paſſeouer was already paſt, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed receiued in the Euening.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ſate downe at a common table with them, verſe 30. If this were the Sacrament: then why ſpeake our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of an holy Altar, and a holy place? For here, the place was an Inne; the Table, a common boord, for ordinarie repaſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they came not prepared to the Sacrament; they ſate downe after a common manner, to eate common meat.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, he had not reuealed himſelfe vnto them, neither knew they what he was. Is it likely, that hee would ſo ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the Sacrament? or they bee ſo careleſſe of right recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Gods holy Sacrament, that they would, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, what hee was, and what he went about, admit him to adminiſter the Sacrament to them? For they knew him not, but in breaking the bread; in the time of that Act, and not before. As if Chriſt would ſteale vpon them with the holy Sacrament, and make them know him in the adminiſtration, and not before? Is this likely?</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, here is no mention of the word of Inſtitution, <hi>This is my body:</hi> which being left out, maketh the breaking of the bread to be no Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, here is neither holy prayers before, nor after, nor any other holy dutie mentioned, fit to be performed at ſo holy an action.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, theſe knew him onely by breaking of bread, verſe 35. but this muſt bee vnderſtood of his ordinarie breaking of bread, bleſſing, and diſtributing, as he did in Math. 14. 19. which theſe Diſciples ſaw. But for his bleſſing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and breaking of the bread, theſe two men had not as yet ſeene. For onely the twelue Apoſtles were there then, and not
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1814:96"/> any of the ſeuenty Diſciples, of which were theſe two. How then could they know him by ſuch an Act as they neuer ſaw him doe?</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, the Rhemiſts dare not affirme it, indeed to bee the Sacrament, but with an <hi>if it be the Sacrament, and as it is moſt probable;</hi> When the Reaſons before ſhew, that it is altogether improbable.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, there be of themſelues which take this place for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie<note place="margin">D. <hi>White, pag. 507.</hi>

                  <p>Eleuenthly, If it was the Sacrament, then Chriſt being the Prieſt, he vſed onely the bread, he conſecrated onely bread, hee adminiſtred onely bread, which was contrary to his firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and contrarie to the Popiſh Prieſts practice, who conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate both, and receiue both. But is it probable that Chriſt would croſſe his former adminiſtration? for Wine hee drunke no more, Luk. 22. 18. Math. 26. 29.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, if it were granted to be the Sacrament, yet hence would it not follow that the Sacrament ſhould bee adminiſtred in one kinde, becauſe Bread is onely mentioned. Firſt, becauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt ſhould adminiſter contrary to his own inſtitution, but few nights before: when hee adminiſtred in both kinds, and had commanded, both to take, and eate the Bread, and <hi>all</hi> to drinke of the Cup. Secondly, breaking bread, and to eate bread, is an vſuall Hebrew phraſe, for to expreſſe whatſoeuer is ſet before men, to eate or drink, Luk. 14. 1. Lam. 4. 4. Eſa. 58. 7. Here bread then is both for Bread and Wine. Thirdly, Theſe two Diſciples were of the ſeuentie, and ſo in Orders. Are theſe then to receiue in one kinde, as the Layicks? Fourthly, if to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter in one kinde be ſufficient, why not to conſecrate in one kinde too? If by their owne iudgement, it be vnlawfull to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate in one kinde, but in both; why not alſo to adminiſter in both? Fiftly, the Apoſtle telleth vs, that the Chalice of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction is the communication of the bloud of Chriſt, 1. Cor. 10. 16. By the Cup then we partake of Chriſts bloud. Let this be diligently conſidered of. Sixtly, the Rhemiſts on Ioh. 6. 98.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1814:96"/> ſect. 11. ſay, that the Prieſts ſhould alwayes receiue both kinds. Mark the reaſons: Firſt, to expreſſe liuely the Paſſion of Chriſt, and the ſeparation of the bloud from his body, in the ſame. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to imitate the whole action and inſtitution. And muſt not Chriſts Paſſion be liuely expreſſed to the people?

Seuenthly, the conſtant practice of the Catholike Church from Chriſts time, from aboue a thouſand yeeres till now of latter times, telleth vs, that the places ſpeaking of the bread, as Act. 2. 42. &amp; 20. 7. are to bee taken for the Sacrament adminiſtred in both kindes. For the conſtant practice ſheweth, that the Church, all that ſpace, tooke it to bee ſo. Eighthly, and laſtly, it was the practice of thoſe Hereticks, the Manichees, to receiue vnder one kinde, of whom the Papiſts are followers; as they be in many other things, of other Heretikes.</p>

                  <head>Confuted by their owne Bible.</head>
                  <p>1. IN their Bible it is called a commemoration of Chriſt, 1. Cor. 11. 24. Luk. 22. 19. Now, a remembrance is of that which is abſent, and not of a thing preſent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, their Bible teacheth vs, that it is vſual in Scripture, ſpeaking of a Sacrament, and of ſignes repreſenting, to giue to the ſignes the very names of the things ſignified thereby. As Gen. 17. 10. Circumciſion is called the Couenant, being onely the ſigne thereof. So the killing and eating of the Lambe, as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1814:97"/> God appointed, is called, the Phaſe, or paſſage, or <hi>Paſche,</hi> is they tranſlate it; or Paſſeouer, as we tranſlate, Exod. 12. 11, 27. Luke 22. 15. as the feſtiuall day was ſo called alſo, Iohn 6. 4. 1. Cor. 10. 4. The Rocke is ſaid to bee Chriſt; which was but a type of him, Tit. 3. 5. Baptiſme is called the Lauer of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Reu. 1. 20. the 7. Candleſticks, are the ſeuen Churches, which did repreſent the Churches: and the myſterie hereof they call there, in their tranſlation, a Sacrament. So the ſeuen eares of Corne, are ſeuen yeeres, Gen. 40. 27. It is vſual to ſpeake in a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, figuratiuely, and not properly. All which places ſhew the meaning of this ſacramentall ſpeech, <hi>This is my bodie;</hi> that is, the ſign of it: the ſigne being called by the thing ſignified, as we ſee in other Sacraments, which muſt teach vs to expound this: as alſo the reſt of the words; this Chalice is the new Teſtament, 1. Cor. 11. 25. this is my bloud of the New Teſtament, Math. 26. 28. this is the Chalice the New Teſtament, Luk. 22. 20. and, Drinke the Chalice (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) which they yeeld to be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely ſpoken; and therefore ſo muſt the other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the name of bread, both before the mentioning of the words of Conſecration by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1. Cor. 11. 23. and after, is ſtill kept, verſe 26, 27, 28. 1. Cor. 10. 16, 17. not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe only ſhew of Bread was ſo to the eye, but for that it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread indeed, and is yet ſo to feeling and taſte, as well as to ſight.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, their Bible telleth vs, that heauen truely hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Chriſt, vntill the times of the reſtitution of all things, Acts 3. 21. Till then, hee commeth not bodily out of heauen: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the bread be heauen it ſelfe, into which at his Aſcenſion he was receiued.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, their Bible telleth vs, that when Chriſt commeth, hee ſhall come from heauen viſibly; ſo come againe, as the Apoſtles ſaw him goe vp, Act. 1. 11. But they ſaw him in his body viſibly aſcend; ſo ſhall he in body come againe, and not in a conceited inuiſibilitie into the Sacrament bodily.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, their owne Bible teacheth, that a body cannot be in two places at one inſtant of time, Mat. 28. 26. <hi>He is not here,</hi> ſaid the Angell: and giueth the reaſon, <hi>For he is riſen.</hi> Becauſe hee
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1814:97"/> was in another place being riſen and gone out of the Sepulchre,<note place="margin">See <hi>Auguſtine in Ioh. tract.</hi> 31. ſhewing that Chriſt is not in two places at one time.</note> the Angell plainely and truely denied him therefore to be there. Now, wee beleeue him to bee euer bodily in heauen. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by an heauenly Angels reaſon wee may truely ſay, that bodily he is not here in the Sacrament, no more then he was in the Sepulchre, becauſe he was riſen.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, their Bible teacheth, that whereſoeuer Chriſts bodie was at any time, hee was diſcernable by ſenſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he willeth his Diſciples to vſe their ſenſe to diſcerne him, Luk. 24. 39. So did <hi>Thomas,</hi> Ioh. 20. 28. But in the Sacrament, is no ſenſibleneſſe at all of his bodily preſence.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, their Bible doth teach, that whenſoeuer God tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one ſubſtance into another, or tooke one away, and put another in ſtead thereof, that the ſame was diſcernable by ſenſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> Staffe was viſibly a Serpent; Duſt in Egypt, was Lice ſeene and felt; and ſo the Water was Bloud ſenſibly, and the Water good Wine (in Ioh. 2. 9. 10.) to the taſte. But in this change at the Sacrament is no ſuch ſenſible perception, and therefore is there no ſuch thing; for God in his miracles delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no mans ſenſe.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, this Paſſeouer did Chriſt certainly eate of with his Diſciples: but the Bread &amp; Wine in the Supper which he inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for this new ſacrament of the new Teſtament, the Apoſtles ate and dranke of, but not a word of Chriſts eating thereof, but onely of the other Iewiſh Sacrament, of which in the Verſes next following hee alſo ſpeakes, ſaying that he would no more drinke of the Vine, verſe 18. as before he ſaid that he would not eate of the Paſſeouer, verſe 16.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I haue before proued, that theſe words are ſpoken in an vſuall Sacramentall phraſe; figuratiuely, and not properly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they cannot be ſpoken but figuratiuely, becauſe Chriſt himſelfe ſpake theſe words. He willed them not to eate his naturall body, which body was viſible before them. Had he his owne body in his hand, and euery one of his Twelue Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles the ſame in their mouthes? then were there thirteene bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Chriſt at one time, at the table: twelue in their hands and mouthes; and one, ſitting apparantly before their eyes.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1814:99"/> One body cannot be in ſo many places at once, as before I haue proued. And what a little body muſt this be which Chriſt held in his owne hand, which he did breake, and which euery of the Apoſtles did put in their mouthes?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The words muſt needs bee figuratiuely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood now, if we conſider the time when Chriſt ſpake them, to wit, before his Paſſion, when as yet his body was not giuen, nor his bloud ſhed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſt ſpake figuratiuely when hee deliuered the ſhop, Mat. 26. 28. Then why more properly in the one, then in the other?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, The end of Chriſts inſtituting this Sacrament, ſhewes it to bee figuratiuely ſpoken. For it was for a remembrance of him, Luk. 22. 19. But if this (vpon the words of conſecration) had beene his very owne bodie, it could not be called pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a remembrance of him: for wee remember by ſignes things abſent, and not things themſelues preſent; for ſo the ſignes were needleſſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Cor. 10. 16. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, is it not the communion of the bloud of Chriſt? The bread which wee breake, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Cor. 11. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh iudgement to himſelfe, not diſcerning the Lords body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no proofe for tranſubſtantiation: but that the Bread is Chriſts body, and the Wine his bloud, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing whereof wee receiue Chriſts very body and bloud. But how? Sacramentally, ſpiritually, by faith: and ſuch as come not prepared to this holy Sacrament, as they ought, eate and drinke vnworthily, not making a difference of this bread and wine, repreſenting Chriſt, from common bread and wine, or a common banquet, which is a grieuous ſinne. All this wee doe acknowledge, neither doe we deny the bread to be the bodie of Chriſt, or the wine his bloud; but yet euer in a Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſpeech, figuratiuely, and not properly. For if the ſigne be the very thing ſignified indeed: then were there no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for it is an outward ſigne of an inuiſible grace.</p>
                  <p>Now there being (as is proued) no tranſubſtantiation, then
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1814:99"/> it followes, that there is no adoration of the Sacrament in that reſpect; nor therein offered any vnbloudy ſacrifice for the quicke and the dead.</p>

                  <head>Confuted by their owne Bible.</head>
                  <p>1. FOr Angels, their owne Bible telleth vs, that the Angels themſelues forbid worſhip to be done to them, Reu. 19. 10. and 22. 9. And ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taught that they ſhould not be worſhipped, Col. 2. 18. Now, prayer to them, is worſhipping of them, and that in a great degree.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for Saints departed, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are not to bee prayed vnto: for they know not our particular eſtates here. Abraham <hi>hath not knowne vs, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath beene ignorant of vs,</hi> Eſa. 63. 16. <hi>The dead know nothing more,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 5.

                  <p>Touching either Angels, or Saints, their Bible alloweth vs not to pray vnto them.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. It teacheth euery where, whereſoeuer there is either a commandement to pray, or an example of any holy man of God praying, that the ſame is made vnto God. For commandement, Pſal. 49. 15. <hi>Inuocate me in the day of trouble,</hi> who is very ready to heare, Eſay 64. 24. Mat. 11. 28. Come vnto me, ſaith Chriſt, and promiſeth them that come vnto him, that hee will not coſt forth, Iob. 6. 37. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Aske of God,</hi> chap. 1. 5. There is no commandement to pray to any other in all the Scripture.

No in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can be giuen to the contrary, in either precept, or example.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Apoſtles deſired to be taught to pray, Luk. 11. Now, Chriſt in his perfect forme of Prayer taught them, and in them,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1814:100"/> all vs, to pray aright. And it is againſt praying to Saints and Angels, in the Preface, <hi>Our Father, which art in Heauen.</hi> Firſt, this is againſt all Shee Saints: for we cannot call the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> nor any woman-Saint, <hi>Father.</hi> Secondly, this is againſt all Angels: for they bee not our Fathers, but Fellow-ſeruants, as they confeſſe, Reuel. 19. 10. Thirdly, this is againſt all Hee-Saints departed: for they be our Brethren; and in Heauen but one Father, Matth. 23. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>In the Petitions which Chriſt willeth vs to pray for; they cannot be made to any of them. We cannot ſay to them, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name, Thy Kingdome come, Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in Heauen.</hi> Can we ſay to them, <hi>Giue vs this day our daily bread, Forgiue vs this day our treſpaſſes, Leade vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the concluſion: for may wee aſcribe to them, and ſay, <hi>Thine is the Kingdome, the power, and the glory for ouer, Amen?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, if we cannot aske of them theſe things, nor aſcribe to them kingdome, power and glory, without horrible idolatrie and ſacriledge; then either Chriſt taught not ſufficiently in this Prayer, to whom and what to pray for; or elſe if he did, then no Saints or Angels are to be prayed vnto.</p>

Fourthly, that Chriſt foreſhewed, that his Diſciples ſhould aske and pray his Father <hi>in his Name,</hi> Ioh. 16. 26. Fifthly, their Bible exhorts vs therefore to goe <hi>to him,</hi> Heb. 13. 13. to offer vp our prayſes (and ſo our prayers) <hi>by him,</hi> Heb. 13. 15. for that hee is able to ſaue vs for
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1814:100"/> euer, Heb. 7. 25. and therefore to goe with confidence to the Throne of Grace, Heb. 4. 16. for in him we haue affiance and acceſſe in confidence by the faith of him, Epheſ. 3. 12. whom the Father euer heareth, Ioh. 11. 42.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Their Bible teacheth vs, that albeit we need, and haue alſo a Mediatour betweene God and vs; yet it is needleſſe to make any Interceſſour to Chriſt: for he is one that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of our infirmities, Heb. 4. 15. he commands vs to come to him, Mat. 11. 28. and is alwayes liuing to make interceſſion for vs, Heb. 7. 25. Seeing then he only is for vs to God, and that we need none betweene him and vs, not any Interceſſour to an Interceſſour; the praying to Saints or Angels is a vaine ſhew of wiſdome in ſuperſtition, and humilitie in a will-worſhip, which the Apoſtle condemneth, Col. 2. 23. Laſtly, it is ſo farre from humilitie, not to doe what God willeth vs to doe, though it may ſeeme otherwiſe to our ſelues, that it is to God grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, Eſay 7. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Ahaz</hi> was willed to aske a ſigne; hee refuſed, holding it to be a tempting of God: but the Prophet reproueth him for it. We are commanded to come to Chriſt. In our conceits this is preſumption; but hauing a warrant ſo to do, we ſinne as <hi>Ahaz</hi> did, and grieue the Lord, in being ruled by our owne wiſdome, and not by Gods Word.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Their Bible teacheth, that prayer can be made to none, but to them in whom we muſt beleeue, Ro. 10. 14. <hi>How ſhall they inuocate, in whom they haue not beleeued?</hi> Therefore except wee beleeue in them, we cannot pray vnto them. But to beleeue in any creature, the ſame Bible forbiddeth, and pronounceth them accurſed which ſo doe, Ier. 17. 5. And in our Creed wee are taught to beleeue in God, and not in any creature, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane-Trent Catechiſme teacheth, in the Article of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Their Bible teacheth, that not onely the members of Gods Church prayed onely to God, but alſo that the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themſelues neuer prayed to any thing, but what they held to be God, Ion. 1. 5, 6. <hi>The men cryed to their god,</hi> verſ. 5. and the gouernor ſaid to <hi>Ionah, Inuocate thy God.</hi> v. 6. Now, Papiſts pray to them which they hold not to be gods, and therefore herein,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1814:101"/> by the witneſſe of their owne Bible, are more abſurd then the Heathen. And yet many of the common people are more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ſtupid on the other ſide. For they worſhip them for ſo many gods, and put no difference betweene them and Chriſt.</p>

Where there is a continuall ioynt act of both, as both being but one indeed. For God, as Eſay ſaith, wil giue his glory to none other. And <hi>Dauid</hi> aſcribes redeeming to the Lord, Pſal. 31. 5.</p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1814:102"/>
                     <p>II. It is cleare, that the Angell, which deliuered <hi>Iacob,</hi> was God, Gen. 31. 11. where the Angell ſaith, that hee is the God of Bethel, verſe 13. This is the Angell whom hee there prayed vnto to be deliuered, chap. 32. 11. and here acknowledgeth to haue redeemed him.</p>
                     <p>III. <hi>Iacob</hi> prayeth that this Angell would bleſſe the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Now God onely giueth bleſſings, Iam. 1. 17. Ioh. 3. 27. Pſal. 84. 11. &amp; 121. 1, 2. and of God, <hi>Iacob</hi> deſired to bee bleſſed, Gen. 32. 26. This Angell therefore was God, and not a created Angell.</p>
                     <p>IV. If they will haue it a created Angell, it may then be thus expounded: The God that feedeth me, &amp; the ſame God which by his Angell, as his inſtrument, deliuereth or redeemeth mee, &amp;c. So as his inuocation is ſtill to God, though hee mentioneth the inſtrument, by which God vſed to deliuer him. For hee ſpeakes here of redemption from euils, and not of that which was wrought by Chriſt in the fleſh, except ſo farre forth, as temporall deliuerances were types of this ſpirituall.</p>
                     <p>Tobie 5. 16. <hi>God which dwelleth in Heauen proſper your iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the Angell of God keepe you company.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, this power of <hi>Tobie</hi> is made to God, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Angell. Hee prayeth God to proſper his iourney: and for this end, he deſireth that Gods Angell might bee ſent with them to keepe them company, which we alſo may and doe pray for in ſuch a caſe. For the Angels haue charge ouer vs, to keepe and defend vs in our wayes and godly courſes.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1814:102"/> for as they ſpeake to Angels: ſo in like manner they ſay, <hi>O yee Sunne and Moone, O yee Starres and light.</hi> And ſo, <hi>O yee winds, fire, and heat, Winter, and Summer, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore by the like reaſon all theſe are to bee prayed vnto: and ſo ſhould wee be worſe then Heathen Idolaters.</p>
                     <p>II. The words expreſſe a duty of their bleſſing and praiſing of God; which they are to performe to God: and not a word of any thing, that they are requeſted to doe for vs.</p>

                     <p>III. This Angell, <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaid, was the Lord. Compare verſe 35. with verſe 38. And when the Angell, verſe 35. ſaid to <hi>Balaam,</hi> onely the word that I ſhall ſpeake vnto thee, that ſhalt thou ſpeake: the Text in chap. 23. 4, 5. ſaith, that <hi>God</hi> met him, and the <hi>Lord</hi> put a word into his mouth: ſo verſe 16.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw. Lot</hi> here prayed not to a created Angell, it is cleare.

                     <p>II. Their owne men ſay, that vnder the Law, as is before ſhewed, there was no praying to Saints. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giueth the reaſon (according to his owne faith) becauſe they were not as yet in heauen.</p>
                     <p>III. This is an example of a damned man, who flyeth with horrour from the preſence of God; who cals not vpon
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1814:103"/> God. Can this be a patterne for Gods Church to follow?</p>
                     <p>IV. This Parable ſpeakes of <hi>Diues</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> as within eyeſight and hearing one of another, though diuided by a gulfe of ſeparation. What is this the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs on earth, to petition Saints in heauen, whom we ſee not, nor cannot certainly tell that they doe heare vs, to giue anſwer againe, as <hi>Abraham</hi> doth here to <hi>Diues?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>V. The example is not of one here on earth praying to one in Heauen, as the proofe ought to be; but of one ſoule to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, both departed this life.</p>
                     <p>Iob 5. 1. <hi>Call now if there bee any that will anſwer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. <hi>Eliphas</hi> exhorts not <hi>Iob</hi> to pray vnto any Saint, but reproues <hi>Iobs</hi> not well-demeaning himſelfe towards God in his afflictions, by ſo iuſtifying himſelfe, as if there were no iuſt cauſe with God thus to deale with him. And to let him fee how herein hee did amiſſe, he willeth him to conſider the examples of the Saints in affliction, whether they did ſo behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and he implyeth that none did ſo, nor carried themſelues as he did.</p>
                     <p>II. Their expounding it of praying to Saints, hath no ground hence. For firſt, the interrogation implyeth a negation, that none of the Saints would anſwer, neither would <hi>Iob</hi> turne to any of them, to haue anſwer from them. Secondly, here is no example of inuocation. And if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> words be vrged as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; what warrant had he to impoſe it on <hi>Iob?</hi> or we, ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it from him? For he was no Prophet, ſent of God to teach <hi>Iob.</hi> And the text telleth vs, that Gods wrath was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, for that he ſpake not of God the thing which was right, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, Iob 42. 7. Thirdly, if the words of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> be vrged, not as a new precept, but as an exhortation to that which was then in practice; why doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other ſay, that before Chriſt no prayers were made to Saints departed? and why doe they alledge places out of the Old Teſtament, herein fighting againſt themſelues?</p>
                     <p>Gen. 48. 16. <hi>Let my name be named on them.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw. Iacob</hi> here willeth not to bee prayed vnto after
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1814:103"/> death; for none of his poſteritie euer ſo did: but hee adopteth <hi>Ioſephs</hi> children, as his owne, and ſo to be called: that is, that <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> ſhould be called the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> or children of Iſrael. The like phraſe is ſo to bee taken, Eſa. 4. 1. Rom. 15. 30. Heb. 13. 18, 19. Iob 42. 8. Gen. 20. and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where one is to pray for another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. Theſe places are ſpoken of one praying for another in this life, and not of any praying to Saints departed. From the liuing to the dead, it followeth not. For men liuing do acquaint one another with their eſtates, and ſo they haue certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof: but it is not ſo betweene the liuing and the dead. It is very vncertaine, whether theſe heare and know what is asked of them.</p>
                     <p>II. There are for this dutie, pregnant precepts, and liuely examples euery where in Scripture, but none ſuch for the other.</p>
                     <p>III. The Scripture doth witneſſe the fruitful effect of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made here, one for another. As <hi>Moſes</hi> his prayers for the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites at the Red Sea, in fighting againſt Amalek, and at other times: So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his prayer, for Ieruſalem, for ouerthrow of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacheribs</hi> Hoſt; and ſo of many others. But the Scripture no where witneſſeth any effect at all, of the prayers of the dead, for any thing here on earth.</p>
                     <p>IV. This praying is mutuall one for another; as we pray others to pray for vs, ſo others deſire our prayers for them. But the departed deſire not ours for them, neither need they our prayers.</p>
                     <p>They alledge other Scriptures to proue, Firſt, <hi>that Angels pray for vs.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that Saints departed know what paſſeth on the earth.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that they doe pray particularly for vs.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that wee may beſeech God to grant our Petitions in fauour and merit of the Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If all this were true and euidently cleere out of Scripture; yet will it not follow, that wee therefore may pray to them. For prayer is a part of Gods worſhip, to bee made onely to God: as precepts dobindlys, the patterne of all true &amp; right praying directeth, and holy mens examples doe teach vs: So this anſwer
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1814:104"/> might ſuffice. Yet, that their proofes from Scripture may not deceiue the vnconſiderate; I wil produce the places for all foure, and make anſwer thereunto.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zach. 1. 12. And the Angell of the Lord anſwered and ſaid, O Lord of Hoſts, how long wilt thou not haue mercy on Ieruſalem, and on the Cities of Iudah, &amp;c?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This was a viſion in the night to the Prophet, verſe 8. and chap. 4. 1. and ſo an extraordinarie thing; and being ſo, and alſo but a repreſentation for the preſent to inſtruct the Prophet, a reall and ordinarie act cannot bee concluded from thence.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, theſe words are not a Prayer, but a kinde of enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, after the Lords purpoſe, touching the future eſtate of the Church, that he might enforme the Prophet thereof, as by the preſent enſuing anſwer may appeare, in verſe 13. and the charge giuen to make the ſame knowne to the Church, verſe 14, 15. for her comfort, in reſtoring her to glory and peace, verſe 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, grant it a Prayer: it will not proue that Angels pray for vs; becauſe this Angell is not a created Angell, but Ieſus Chriſt, who is often called in the Old Teſtament, an Angell, as before is ſhewed. And that this Angell is ſo to bee taken, is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: For firſt, the Prophet calleth this Angell, <hi>his Lord,</hi> verſ. 9. chap. 4. 4, 5. Secondly, the Text calleth him, <hi>the Lord,</hi> and maketh this Angell and the Lord, all one, verſe 19, 20, 21. Thirdly, to this Angell the other gaue an account, verſe 11. Fourthly, before this Angell ſtood <hi>Ioſua</hi> the High Prieſt, chap. 3. 1, 3. and he is called the Lord, verſe 2. <hi>The Lord ſaid vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> The Lord rebuke thee, Satan.</p>
                     <p>Tobie 12. 12. <hi>I did bring the remembrance of your prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy One.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He that is here brought in for an Angell of God, in chap. 5. 12. told no better then a lye: for he ſaid he was <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:1814:104"/> the ſonne of <hi>Ananias,</hi> a mortall mans ſonne: He could not then be an Angell; or if an Angell, a lying one. And as hee made a lye therein, ſo might he doe in this, chap. 12. 12, 15.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this place doth not proue that Angels pray for vs. For he ſaith not, that he prayed for them; but if the lyer may be beleeued, he brought their prayers vnto Gods remembrance, and preſented them, verſ. 15. as one taking a Petition of another man to preſent it to a King; he is the preſenter of it, but not the Petitioner.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this Booke is Apocrypha, and ſuſpected of idle fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſuch as learned Papiſts doe meanely eſteeme of.</p>
                     <p>Reu. 8. 4. <hi>And the ſmoake of the Incenſe, which came with the prayers of the Saints, aſcended from the hand of the Angell before God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no created Angell, but Ieſus Chriſt; which is cleere by theſe reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from the alluſion to the Prieſts office ſeruing at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; who was a type, not of a created Angell, but of Chriſt, Heb. 9. 11. Then, from the place, where this Angell ſtands; which was at the Altar, to offer vpon the golden Altar, which was before the Throne: but the Angels are in the out cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the Church, chap. 5. 11. as her guard to keepe her, Pſal. 34. 7.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is not ſaid that hee offered vp the Saints prayers, but he offered vp <hi>Incenſe with their prayers.</hi> It accompanied the Saints prayers, verſe 4. <hi>and the ſmoake of the Incenſe aſcended vp with the prayers of the Saints.</hi> Chriſts Spirit goeth with the prayers of the Saints, like Incenſe, and the vehemencie thereof (teaching vs to pray with groanes that cannot bee expreſſed, Rom. 8.) is like ſmoke aſcending vp before God; or the Incenſe is Chriſts own interceſſion, &amp; the ſmoake the efficacie thereof accompanying the Saints prayers vnto God: for when wee pray, he then prayeth for vs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, moſt of the Papiſts which doe write vpon this Text, doe hold this Angell to be Chriſt. <hi>Peter Bullenger, Thom. Aquin. Rich. de Sancto victore, Haymo, Dion. Carthuſ. Viegas,</hi> and many other. This is nothing then for Angels praying for vs.</p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:1814:105"/>
                     <p>Dan. 8. 15. <hi>When I</hi> Daniel <hi>had ſeene the viſion, &amp;c.</hi> and chap. 9. 20, 21. while I was ſpeaking in Prayer, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The former Text ſpeakes nothing at all, of any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels praying: but of the Angels inſtructing <hi>Daniel</hi> at Gods commandement, chap. 8. 16, 17. This was alſo a viſion in a deepe ſleepe, verſe 18. From whence Doctrines of Faith are not to be concluded, but ſoundly to be taught from the literall ſenſe of other holy Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>II. The latter Text ſheweth, that <hi>Daniel</hi> praying to God, chap. 9. 20. the Angell of the Lord was ſent to him, verſe 21. but no mention of any prayer made by the Angell for him.</p>
                     <p>Whether Angels pray for vs, the Scripture teacheth not. If wee yeeld that they doe, it followes not that we ſhould pray to<note place="margin">See D. <hi>White</hi> his laſt booke, in anſwer to Luk. 15. 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 315, 316. to 1. Cor. 4. 9. <hi>pag. 317.</hi>
                        </note> them. The Angels are ſent out by God for vs, they are often with vs, they are helpers, and by comming and going at Gods bidding, they doe know our affaires here. But ſhould wee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray to them? it is a part of Gods worſhip: and Angels themſelues, as before is proued, forbid to be worſhipped.</p>

                     <p>Luk. 16. 29. <hi>They haue Moſes and the Prophets, let them heare them.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is a Parable, and a thing ſuppoſed onely, not a literall Hiſtory. For after the very letter, ſome things in this Parable cannot be true; and therefore they cannot hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Doctrine, as out of a Hiſtorie. If this place will ſerue for Saints knowledge, from <hi>Abraham;</hi> how can the Papiſts looke on this Text, hindring the people from the Scripture? When firſt <hi>Abraham</hi> exhorts to the hearing of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. Secondly, denyeth the ſending of the dead to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, as Papiſts haue beene inſtructed for their feigned Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. Thirdly, he affirmeth that they which will not heare the Scriptures written by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue ſuch as riſe from the dead. Thus he confirmeth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Scriptures, againſt wandring viſions &amp; apparitions.</p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:1814:105"/>
                     <p>Secondly, the Papiſts ſay, that before Chriſts Aſcenſion, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarks were in the place called <hi>Limbus patrum.</hi> How could <hi>Abraham</hi> know what was done in Earth, when he was in the priſon? Perhaps by enquirie made of other Soules, which came thither, how the Church did, and what other meanes of inſtruction ſhe had, then when hee liued on the earth?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if but ſo: what is this to proue that Saints then, and ſo now, doe know euery mans eſtate particularly, and what paſſeth here vpon earth?</p>
                     <p>Ioh. 5. 45. <hi>There is one that accuſeth you, euen</hi> Moſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By <hi>Moſes</hi> is not meant his perſon, but his writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, as the verſes 46. and 47. doe declare.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is abſurd to make the Saints in Heauen accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. Papiſts will haue them Interceſſors, whoſe propertie is not to accuſe in any ſort, but to pray for them, which pray to them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt ſaith, they truſt in <hi>Moſes.</hi> Will a Saint in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen bee ſo diſpleaſed with them, and ſo faile them that truſt in him, that hee will goe and accuſe them vnto God? Such then become miſerable Patrons. Doth their Legend afford any ſuch examples?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Chriſts ſaying that they truſted in <hi>Moſes,</hi> muſt not be vnderſtood of his perſon: but of his writings. For the Iewes did not beleeue in man. A curſe, as is before deliuered, they knew to be pronounced againſt them, which truſted in man.</p>
                     <p>Reu. 12. 10. <hi>The accuſer of the brethren is caſt downe, which accuſed them before God day and night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the former, they make <hi>Moſes</hi> an accuſer of ſome; and ſo in that reſpect, a companion with the diuell heere. Is not this a wiſe <hi>Gagger?</hi> But how can they proue hence, that Saints in Heauen know what is done here? Becauſe the diuell knowes what euils are here done. A goodly reaſon. But doe not wee know, that the Diuell is here on earth; that hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth the earth to and fro? Hee ſtirres vp <hi>Dauid</hi> to number the people; hee is author of much miſchiefe: hee muſt then know many things. And will it hence follow therefore,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1814:106"/> that ſoules which remaine continually in heauen, muſt know what is here done in earth?</p>
                     <p>2. King. 6. 12. <hi>Eliſha</hi> telleth, what words the King of Syria ſpake, being farre from him. So 2. King. 5. 26. <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaw what paſſed between <hi>Naaman</hi> and <hi>Gehezi,</hi> 1. Cor. 12. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was rapt vp into the third Heauen, Act. 7. <hi>Steuen</hi> in earth, ſaw Chriſt in heauen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe places tell vs, that theſe things were ſo. Let them bring vs Scriptures which will affirme as much of the ſoules in heauen, heere ſeeing things in earth, and we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. But this theſe places proue not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, theſe were extraordinarie reuelations, and giue no warrant of ordinarie knowledge. In ſuch things, from extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie acts to ordinarie, is no ſound arguing. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did not know all things. <hi>Eliſha</hi> knew not the cauſe of the Shunamites comming, 2. King. 4. 27. nor <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he went to <hi>leſſe</hi> his houſe, whom God would chuſe, 1. Sam. 16. 6.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, all theſe are inſtances of knowledge, in men on earth, of things done on earth; or of things which being on earth, they ſaw in heauen: but not a word, what thoſe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſaw here vpon earth; which is the onely point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gagger</hi> quoteth moe places, As Mat. 19. 28. But this is nothing to purpoſe. And the place is meant of all, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring before Chriſt, at the laſt day, whom the Apoſtles ſhall then ſee.</p>
                     <p>Reu. 2. 26. 1. Here is a promiſe, accompliſhed in Chriſt,<note place="margin">See D. <hi>White</hi> his laſt booke, <hi>p</hi> 309. 310, 311, 312. in anſwer to this; as alſo to Reu. 3. 12. 1. Cor. 13. 9. &amp; 5. 10. not cited by the <hi>Gagger.</hi>
                        </note> Pſal. 2. in whom the Saints haue this power. See <hi>Auguſtine, Beda,</hi> and many other, cited by <hi>Fulke</hi> on this place, for this ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this is to bee vnderſtood of the Saints power ouer thoſe out of the Church. For here they are to bee ruled with a rodde of iron, and to be broken in pieces. But the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Papiſts make Protectors of others, and not breakers of them to ſhiuers.</p>
                     <p>Act. 5. 3. This was an extraordinarie manifeſtation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> his hypocriſie to <hi>Peter.</hi> If they can proue, that God doth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1814:106"/> reueale mens actions here, to Saints in Heauen, wee yeeld.</p>
                     <p>1. Sam. 28. 14. Here is the Diuell appearing in <hi>Samuelt</hi> likeneſſe: what hence this <hi>Gagger</hi> will gather for Saints know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in heauen, I know not.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, here is not meant the Saints departed; but theſe foure and twenty are the type of the whole Church here on earth, verſe 10.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, theſe prayers of the Saints (which Saints are on earth, chap. 8. 3.) may be the prayers of the foure and twenty Elders themſelues: yet called the prayers of the Saints, as if they were the prayers of others.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for that theſe repreſent the whole Church, verſe 9. which conſiſts of Saints.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe a Church or Congregation of people ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, pray not onely for themſelues, but for all the Saints of God; and ſo their hearts here being as Vials, full of the grace of Prayer, as it were odours, are eſteemed the prayers of all Saints.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Tho. Aquinas, Rich. de Sco. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictore, Haymo, Beda,</hi> and other, doe expound this place of the Church militant.</p>
                     <p>2. Mach. 15. 14. <hi>Then</hi> Onias <hi>anſwered, &amp;c.</hi> Where he telleth how <hi>Ieremy</hi> prayed for the people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is an Apocryphal Booke.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this ſpeech of <hi>Onias</hi> touching <hi>Ieremies</hi> praying, was but <hi>Iudas</hi> his dreame. For it is ſaid in verſe 11. that he told the ſouldiers al this, as his dreame, to encourage them to fight. It is weake architecture to build vpon a dreame, doctrines of faith.</p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:1814:107"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, neither did <hi>Iudas</hi> much regard the helpe of <hi>Ieremies</hi> prayer. For in the ſame Chapter, hee himſelfe did pray, verſe 21, 22, 23. but intreated not <hi>Ieremy</hi> to pray for him, but made his ſuite onely to God.</p>
                     <p>Ier. 15. 1. <hi>Though</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>ſtood before me, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe words are ſpoken onely by way of ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if God had ſaid, If <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> were now before mee, as they were, when they liued on earth, praying for theſe people, I ſhould not regard them. Is it good reaſoning from a ſuppoſitiue ſpeech, to a reall act indeed?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they themſelues ſay, that all the Fathers that were before Chriſt, were in <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> and ſo could not know our affaires in particular to pray for vs.</p>
                     <p>Baruch 3. 4. <hi>Heare now the prayers of the dead Iſraelites.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, were not theſe in the place, called <hi>Limbus Patrum?</hi> How could they then ſee all things in the face of God, from whoſe preſence they were kept?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, heere is mention of the prayers of dead Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites: but not for whom they prayed. It is not ſaid, they prayed for others on earth. They might pray for themſelues in <hi>Limbo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, by dead Iſraelites, are not here to bee vnderſtood ſuch as were departed this life, but ſuch as were accounted as dead, as going downe to the graue; for ſo <hi>Baruch</hi> ſpeakes to Iſrael, verſe 9, 11. And hee ſpeakes of ſuch dead Iſraelites and their children, which had ſinned before God, and had not hearkened to him, verſe 4. expreſſing their deſerts worthy death. Doe men aliue, requeſting God to heare for them the prayers of the dead, vſe to moue God with telling of the Saints ſinnes, and their rebellion againſt him? Is this a Romiſh prayer, Heare, Lord, the prayers of the dead for mee, for they haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt thee? Will any be ſo madde, to alledge ſuch a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Therefore <hi>Baruch</hi> makes confeſſion of the liuing Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, being then through diſtreſſe as dead men; and beggeth pardon for them, as followeth in verſe 5.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, their <hi>Doway</hi> Annotation on this place is this; Men in ſinnes and miſeries are as if they were dead, verſe 11. yet by
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1814:107"/> Gods mercy may receiue new grace of ſpirituall life. They then take theſe for men aliue, and not dead, as this fooliſh <hi>Gagger</hi> doth.</p>
                     <p>Reu. 2. 26, 27. This is anſwered before, and nothing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the prayers of the Saints departed.</p>
                     <p>Luk 16. <hi>Diues in hell prayed for his brethren on earth:</hi> much more then will the Saints in heauen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is but a ſuppoſed ſpeech, a parable, and therefore nothing thence to be gathered, but as is intended in the ſcope of the Parable.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if there bee ſuch all-knowing viſion, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helping charitie in Heauen, it is maruell that in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it ſhould no where as clearely be mentioned, as this chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of one damned in hell.</p>
                     <p>Reuel. 6. 9, 10. <hi>And I ſaw vnder the Altar the ſoules, &amp;c. and they cryed with a lowd voice, How long, Lord, holy, and true! doeſt thou not iudge and auenge our bloud, on them that dwell on the earth?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This was ſeene by <hi>Iohn</hi> in a viſion; and is not to bee interpreted according to the Letter, to eſtabliſh a doctrine of faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, though it be taken after the letter; yet here is no proofe that Saints pray for any in particular, but for the Church militant in generall.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, their Prayer is not for other in the Church; they intercede not for other, but the requeſt they make, concerneth themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, their cry is literally for iuſtice and reuenge vpon their enemies, perſecutors, and ſheaders of their bloud. Doth mindfulneſſe of iniuries remaine in Saints departed? They then are leſſe charitable then Saints on earth. <hi>Steuen</hi> at his death prayed for his enemies. This place proueth not, that Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted pray particularly here for vs on earth; but rather they pray againſt the enemies of the Church.</p>
                     <p>2. Pet. 1. 15. <hi>I will endeuour after my deceaſe to haue remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of theſe things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is not meant by his interceſſion to God after
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1814:108"/> death, but of his then preſent and diligent writing to them while he was aliue, whereby they might bee made to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber after his deceaſe, what hee had taught them by word of mouth or writing, while he liued.</p>
                     <p>1. King. 2. 13, 19. Adoniah <hi>had a ſuite to</hi> Solomon, <hi>and uſed the helpe of</hi> Bathſheba <hi>to him;</hi> Abſalom <hi>vſed</hi> Ioabs <hi>interceſſion, for him to</hi> Dauid, 2. Sam. 14. So ſhould we goe vnto God by Saints, interceſſors for vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Similitudes are for illuſtration, but doe not proue any thing, eſpecially thus detorted abſurdly.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the caſe is not alike, as betweene man and man, ſo betweene God and vs, in this caſe. Hee is God, and ſo euery where, and not as man, circumſcribed in a place. To man wee cannot ſpeake when and where we would: but to God wee may, whoſe eyes and thoughts are not like to mans, Eſai. 55. Man, through pride, will not; or through careleſneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not; or through ignorance, knowes not; or through bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, is hindered, ſo as hee cannot helpe ſuch as come for helpe: or his attendants about him, may keepe Petitioners from him, ſo as they cannot ſpeake to him. But there are no ſuch lets in God. The Simile therefore is not fit.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this is voluntarie humilitie, which cauſed the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Angels by certaine Heretikes, which the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth, Col. 2. 18.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, wee need no Saints to goe to God for vs: for wee haue appointed by God himſelfe, a Mediatour of interceſſion betweene God and vs, his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, by whom boldly with confidence, we may goe to God, Epheſ. 3. 12. Heb. 4. 16. &amp; 10. 22. &amp; 7. 25.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, as for any to goe betweene Chriſt and vs, wee neede it not: For he is the Head, and all wee the members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as well thoſe in earth, as thoſe in heauen; wee here on earth, being as deare to him, as thoſe in heauen. Hee ſitteth in heauen to requeſt for vs, and is a moſt mercifull High Prieſt, touched with our infirmities, Heb. 4. 15. Therefore hee tooke our nature vpon him, Heb. 2. 16. to be a faithfull and mercifull High Prieſt, verſe 17. <hi>Steuen</hi> made no meanes to him, but
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1814:108"/> prayed immediately to him, Act. 7. 59, 60. and ſo did <hi>Iohn,</hi> Reuelation 22. 20, 21. Chriſt willeth vs himſelfe to come vnto him, Math. 11. 28. And we reade not that any of the Apoſtles, or holy men, praying, mentioned in Scripture, did euer goe to Saint or Angell to make requeſt for them. Alſo, to anſwer the Simile: Is there any of vs, hauing a great mans Command, in all our needs to come to himſelfe, giuing his faithfull word and promiſe to heare our ſuites &amp; requeſts very readily at any time, and none appointed by him to heare ſuiters, when they come, but onely himſelfe, attending mercifully in his owne perſon for vs, in open place without let of any, that would goe firſt to any of his ſeruants, and not forthwith rather to himſelfe with all gladneſſe? I appeale to mens owne hearts in this.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, this putting of Saints betweene Chriſt and vs, is to make an Interceſſor, and to hold Saints departed (if wee were ſure they could heare vs, which yet is very vncertaine) to bee more louing, more tenderly affected toward vs, then Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, who hath with his owne bloud bought both them and vs.</p>

                     <p>Exod. 32. 13. <hi>Remember</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Iſrael <hi>thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, to whom thou ſwareſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no merit of Saints vrged.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, their perſons are mentioned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> not for their owne worthineſſe, but for the Couenant which by oath God confirmed to them; which Couenant <hi>Moſes</hi> vrgeth, &amp; not their deſerts. For <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes of Gods act to them, but not a ſyllable of any thing, that they either did, or ſpake; note it well.</p>
                     <p>2. Chron. 6. 16. <hi>Keepe with thy ſeruant</hi> Dauid <hi>my Father, that which thou haſt promiſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no word, no worke of <hi>Dauid</hi> remembred, and therefore no merit of his vrged.</p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1814:109"/>
                     <p>Secondly, that which <hi>Salomon</hi> alledgeth in his prayer, it Gods promiſe made vnto <hi>Dauid.</hi> So in 2. Chro. 1. 9. in 1. Chro. 29. 18. <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth to God in that title which hee would be named by, and by which he named himſelfe, Exo. 3. 6. So it is a calling vpon God by his name, and not praying to him through the merits of Saints departed.</p>
                     <p>Exod. 20. 5. <hi>And ſhewing mercy vnto thouſands of them that loue me, and keepe my commandement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is no whit for Saints prayer, but altogether againſt merit. For the Text ſaith, that to thoſe which loue him and keepe his commandements, God will ſhew mercy. If they did merit, what need they or mercy? The Gagger ſaith, that God will here reward the merits of good men; when hee onely ſaith he will ſhew mercy, and mentioneth no merit.</p>
                     <p>Pſal. 132. 1. <hi>Lord, remember</hi> Dauid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This Pſalme penned by <hi>Dauid,</hi> is a Prayer made by himſelfe for himſelfe, and ſo nothing to the point of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Secondly, if penned by ſome other, after <hi>Dauids</hi> time; here, by <hi>Dauid,</hi> is meant Gods promiſe made vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> of which the Pſalmiſt maketh mention in verſe 11, 12, 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>Eſai. 63. 17. <hi>Returne for: thy ſeruants ſake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is, for thy Couenants ſake, made vnto thy ſeruants. So Pſal. 32. 10. <hi>For thy ſeruant</hi> Dauids <hi>ſake:</hi> that is, for the Couenant and promiſe ſake, made vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> as the Verſes 11, 12. following, ſhew; and not for the merit and interceſſion of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Alſo <hi>Dauid</hi> is here named, becauſe hee was an excellent type of Chriſt, who therefore is called by the Name of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Ier. 23. 5. and 30. 9. Ezech. 37. 24. Oſea 3. 4. So that if the words be taken for <hi>Dauid;</hi> then there is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Gods promiſes, the perſon put for the Couenant made to him: but taken for him that <hi>Dauid</hi> typed out; then is it for Chriſt his ſake, conceiued in the name <hi>Dauid.</hi> And ſo the Text proues not prayer made to God, to be granted for the merits of Saints.</p>

               <p>This wee deny to be of neceſſitie. But they affirme it to bee ſuch an ordinance of Chriſt, as not onely hee which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and contemne it; but whoſoeuer doth neglect or omit the ſame when he may haue it, cannot be ſaued.</p>

                  <p n="1">I.

Therefore there is pardon without this burthenſome ordinance, which is maintained ſo ſtrictly among the Romaniſts, that thereby the Prieſts may tyrannize ouer the conſciences of the poore Lay-Catholiques, and further ſerue their owne turnes for politique ends.</p>
                  <p n="3">III.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is mention indeed of confeſſion, but this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not impoſed priuate confeſſion, ſecretly in the Prieſts eare. For firſt, this is of a confeſſion voluntary, not enforced. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of many that did it: but not of all. Thirdly, publike, and not in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> eare. For as they ſhewed their workes, and brought their bookes, and burnt them before all men, verſe 19; So was
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1814:111"/> this confeſſion open: for the Text maketh no difference of theſe actions. Fourthly, Here it is ſaid, they confeſſed: but no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar enumeration of ſinnes with circumſtances. Fiftly, <hi>Caietan</hi> a Cardinall, in his Commentarie hereof, holdeth, that this place is not meant of Auricular confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Iam. 5. 16. <hi>Confeſſe your faults one to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is nothing for the Popiſh confeſſion. For firſt, it is as generall as prayer one for another. But Prayer is a dutie common to all. Secondly, he ſaith not, the prayer of the Prieſt, but of a righteous man. And I hope that others beſide Prieſts are righteous men. Thirdly, here is not a word of abſolution: but a promiſe to the prayer of faith, not to the Prieſts words, to ſaue the ſicke, and to haue his ſinnes pardoned, verſe 15. Fourthly, confeſſion commanded heere, is not confined to a Prieſt, but may extend to any other.</p>
                  <p>This Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes to all, to whom he wrote his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. And this place is to be vnderſtood one of theſe three wayes. Firſt, either of Prieſts and people: and then are the Prieſts bound to confeſſe, as well to the people, as the people to them. For its ſaid, <hi>Confeſſe one to another,</hi> that is, mutually, or recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. Secondly, or heere is vnderſtood onely of Prieſts among themſelues, and then is there nothing to the people. Thirdly, or onely of the people among themſelues, and then is this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Prieſt, to take authoritie hence, to bind the people to confeſſe to him. Fourthly, confeſſion here is not of ſecret ſinnes in heart againſt God, or ſinnes hidden from men, but of treſpaſſes or offences one againſt another, as the word in the Originall ſheweth, and is ſo taken in <hi>Marke</hi> 11. 25, 26. Vpon which grieuances, mutuall confeſſion or acknowledgement of wrongs is here enioyned as a fit meanes of brotherly reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and preſeruation of peace among themſelues. To which they muſt adde prayer, one for another, that their mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion reciprocally, for reconciliation, may bee bleſſed vnto them. Of which practice, happy are they which make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and bleſſed ſhould we be, if to this euery man would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe. A harder taske, then to whiſper his ſinnes in a Prieſts eare ſecretly.</p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:1814:112"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Rhemiſts ſay vpon this text, that it is not certaine that S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh here of Sacramentall confeſſion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon others, in alledging Scriptures for Auricular confeſſion, leaue out this place, as not to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Mat. 3. 5, 6. <hi>Then went out to him Ieruſalem, and all Iudea, and all the Region round about Iordane, and were baptized in Iordane, confeſſing their ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This ſorteth not with Popiſh Auricular Confeſſion, and that for theſe three reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this was publike, not in a corner of the Temple, or of a Synagogue, but in the place where he baptized them in Iordan, before all the people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this was at their firſt conuerſion receiuing Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and not yeerely at ſet times.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, its not certaine, what ſinnes, or how many, whether in generall, or particular, they confeſſed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it was impoſſible for <hi>Iohn</hi> to heare euery mans pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate confeſſion, with enumeration of circumſtances, ſeeing all Iudea, and all the Region about Iordane, and Ieruſalem, went out to him; meaning very many, and multitudes of people.</p>
                  <p>Leuit. 13. 2. &amp; 14. 2. <hi>The Leper ſhall bee brought vnto the Prieſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no mention of confeſſion of ſinnes: but of one brought to the Prieſt, to take a view of the Plague of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie vpon the body, verſe 9, 10. All the argument therefore that can hence be drawne, is onely typicall, not conuicting.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the partie was not to come and confeſſe himſelfe a Leper to the Prieſt: but the Prieſt was to iudge him ſo, and to pronounce him a Leper, chap. 13. 3, 11, 44. <hi>Then ſhould the Leper cry and confeſſe, not to the Prieſt, but to the people,</hi> that hee was vncleane, verſe 45.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this iudgement of the Leproſie, by a plaine Law, here belonged to the Prieſt. But where can they ſhew a Law onely for their Prieſts to heare priuate confeſſion after their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh manner?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Prieſt looking vpon the partie, was not in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, betweene them two; but before other: for hee was
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1814:112"/> brought vnto the Prieſt by others to bee viewed.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the Prieſt did not alwayes profeſſe the partie cleane, vpon ſhewing his malady, as the Popiſh Prieſt doth euer the Confitent, vpon ſhewing his ſins by confeſſion: but the Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Prieſt put the partie apart from all others a time for a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Leuit. 13. 4, 5. and after tryall, pronounced the party vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, and ſhut him out of the aſſembly of the people, verſe 46. Numb. 5. 2. Which the popiſh Prieſt neuer doth: who vpon confeſſion runnes to remitting and looſing, but not at all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and binding: and yet he that may doe the one, may and ought to doe the other.</p>
                  <p>Numb. 5. 7. <hi>Then ſhall they confeſſe their ſinne, which they haue done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. This ſinne is not euery euill in thought, word, and deed, or a numbring vp of all ſinnes, that may be remembred, as Papiſts require: but onely of ſome treſpaſſes betweene man and man; as when one coozeneth another, or violently hath wronged another in ſuch things wherein reſtitution may and ought to be made, as is cleere in this text, ſpeaking of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſing the treſpaſſe, as alſo in Leuit. 6. 2, 3, 4, 5. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſame with this text, and expreſſing the particulars. In this caſe of reſtoring and recompenſing, reaſon requireth an acknowledgement of particulars, to ſhew why, and for what, reſtitution is made.</p>
                  <p>II. The text ſpeaketh of confeſſion, but doth not expreſſe to whom, whether to God, or to his neighbour, or to the Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it may be meant to God, when the offendour ſeeth his ſinne, and humbleth himſelfe before God, confeſſing and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pardon: for to ſuch God promiſeth mercy, Prou. 28. 13. So <hi>Dauid</hi> confeſſed, Pſal. 51. 4. and obtained pardon, Pſal. 32. 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may be vnderſtood of confeſſion to man, to the party wronged, as <hi>Ioſua</hi> exhorted <hi>Achan</hi> to doe to him before the people, Ioſh. 7. 19. Of this ſpeakes our Sauiour in Luk. 17. 4. Mat. 5. 23. 24. And this text in <hi>Numbers,</hi> doth leade to this. For here is immediately ioyned recompence of the treſpaſſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. This latter dutie is performed to the partie offended, as
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1814:113"/> the text ſheweth in Leu. 6. 5. and what hindereth that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhould not be ſo too, ſeeing the text ſpeaketh after confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo much of reſtitution to the partie offended, or to his kinſman in the firſt place, before any mention made of the Prieſt? Of whom when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes, he mentioneth no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate confeſſion to him, not a word of the Prieſt hearing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, but of the man bringing his treſpaſſe-offering, and of the Prieſt making atonement thereby, Leu. 6. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if this confeſsion be made to the Prieſt, it helps no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Popiſh priuy confeſſion. For the Prieſt did not ſit in a corner to heare confeſsion within the Tabernacle, for within came none of the people, but onely in the out Court, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came the man with his offerings to the Prieſt in the view and hearing of the Prieſts and people, for one man and one Prieſt was not alone in the out-Court, as it is in Popiſh Shrift.</p>
                  <p>To conclude the anſwer to this; The Papiſts owne <hi>Lyranus,</hi> who had beene ſometimes a Iew, ſaith on Leu. 16. 21. that the Prieſt did not heare the particular confeſſions of the people, for that had been impoſsible, but onely in generall.</p>
                  <p>Ioh. 11. 14. <hi>Ieſus ſaith vnto them, Looſe him, and let him goe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no mention of confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if this looſing noted the Prieſts abſolution, then the Prieſt muſt abſolue publikely, and alſo without confeſſion, and after men to riſen from the dead, as well as before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it cannot be proued that the commandement giuen to <hi>looſe him,</hi> was ſpoken to Chriſts Diſciples. It is likely <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> and <hi>Mary, Lazarus</hi> his louing Siſters, would bee moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to doe this, before all other, and the Iewes which came to them to comfort them, verſe 31. who, as it is moſt probable, are they, to whom Chriſt ſpake to take away the ſtone, verſe 39. For when Chriſt ſpeakes to his Diſciples, its vſuall in the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt to expreſſe the ſame, and to mention the deeds and ſayings of the Diſciples which are here omitted. Alſo the Relatiue <hi>them</hi> in this 44. verſe, muſt bereferred to the perſons beforenamed, in verſe 36. 39. which were Iewes, when no mention was made of his Diſciples, from verſe 16. Is it like that the Relatiue in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1814:113"/> verſe 44. ſhould haue relation to verſe 16. when there is ſeuen and twenty verſes betweene? Now if Chriſt ſpeake to the Iewes, and they looſed him, and not the Diſciples, then this place is vainely alledged.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this is but an allegorizing vpon a text; and an allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall interpretation not intended in the text, is a weake, yea, an idle proofe, in a controuerted point of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>But in concluſion, I would haue theſe Gaggers know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that our Church doth not baniſh Confeſſion made to the Miniſter, and euen priuately, when men finde their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences burthened, and diſtreſſed, that they may receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, comfort &amp; abſolution, ſealed vnto their ſoules, by the execution, and applying of the power of the Keyes, whereof our Church of England is as truely and rightfully poſſeſſed, as any Church in the world. But our Church hath duely reiected the corruptions of confeſſion, which ſtand in the heauy yoake of abſolute neceſſitie of ſuch confeſſing and particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall enumeration of ſinnes, which hath no warrant by the Word of God, nor example of practice in the ancient Church.</p>

                  <hi>XXVI. Propoſition.</hi> That there is a place, commonly called Purgatorie, into which, ſoules after diſſolution from the bodie, doe goe, wherein, as in a priſon, ſuch as here haue not ſatisfied by temporall paine due for ſinnes, doe make ſatisfaction in ſuffering helliſh torment, it is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine how long.</head>
               <p>WE deny that there is any ſuch place, and hold that this is a very fiction for gaine to the Pope-god of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church. But they affirme the contrary, and teach that there is ſuch a place neere vnto hell, and that the torments thereof are inſufferable as theſe of hell, but onely that in hell there is no redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas from this, there is, ſay they.</p>

                  <head>This Purgatorie pick-purſe is confuted by their owne Bible.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, in their Bible wee may finde all the places which euer God made, Heauen, Earth, Sea, and Hell; but it no where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth any place called <hi>Purgatorie.</hi> Therefore there is no ſuch place of Gods making.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in their Bible we may finde only two ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Elect and Reprobate, Sheepe and Goates, bleſſed and curſed, Math. 25. 34, 41. Not a meane betweene both. Two gates and wayes, the ſtrait and narrow, the broad and wide, one on the right hand, and another on the left. Two kindes of workes, good and euill, 2. Cor. 5. 10. A twofold reward, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment euerlaſting, and life euerlaſting, Mat. 25. 46. Two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to receiue the reward in; the kingdome prepared for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from the beginning of the world, Math. 25. 34. and fire euerlaſting, prepared for the Deuill and his angels, verſe 41.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it affords vs many texts againſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 24. The hearer and beleeuer in Chriſt hath euerlaſting life, and he commeth not into iudgement, but ſhall paſſe from death, into life. If he come not into iudgement, hee cannot be caſt into a place of puniſhment. To ſuch as be in Chriſt, there is no condemnation, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. For by Gods grace are wee iuſtified <hi>gratis</hi> by redemption that is in Chriſt, Rom. 3. 24. and hee hath ſet vs free, Ioh. 8. 36. free from ſinne, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the guilt, as alſo of puniſhment. Elſe how are we free? Are Gods workes imperfect?</p>
                  <p>2. Cor. 5. 1. Wee know that if our earthly houſe of this habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be diſſolued, that we haue a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternall in heauen. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of himſelfe, and of all true Chriſtians, in this word <hi>wee:</hi> of whom he ſaith, that after death, they haue their houſe for euer in heauen; hee puts no lodging or Inne of <hi>Purgatory</hi> betweene. And in the tenth verſe of the ſame Chapter hee ſaith, that at the laſt Day euery one is to receiue as hee hath done in this bodie. So whileſt man liueth here in bodie, and not as hee
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1814:114"/> ſuffers in ſoule in <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> is hee conſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. By one oblation hath hee conſummated for euer thoſe that are ſanctified. Note here 1. That Chriſt hath made an oblation for his. 2. That this is but one. 3. That this one<note place="margin">Col 2. 13, 4. 1. Ioh. 1. 7.</note> hath conſummate and made his perfect. 4. And that for euer. So as in verſe 17. its ſaid, that their ſinnes and iniquities I will now remember no more. And will he yet puniſh them in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory? Will he cleanſe them from all ſinne, pardon all offences, not imputing ſinne, Rom. 4. 8. and yet will he exact a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Its vnreaſonable to thinke it.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 17. Where the Apoſtle ſpeakes of thoſe aliue at the laſt Day, to be onely changed, and ſo taken vp to Chriſt. All the elect at that time ſhall eſcape Purgatorie; or it may bee, it will then be blowne out, or it and hell turned into one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 10. Here the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of perfecting all in Chriſt, in heauen and in earth. Note how hee here onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth two places, in which thoſe be, who haue benefit by Chriſt: thoſe in Heauen, and in Earth. The Apoſtle forgot them which were frying in Purgatorie. If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had beleeued ſuch a place, where hope of Saluation had beene, would he haue left thoſe ſoules comfortleſſe?</p>
                  <p>Reu. 14. 13. Bleſſed are the dead which dye in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours. Where reſt is, there is no torment. It were ſmall comfort to thinke this to be ſpoken of the body, for ſo beaſts and beaſtly men reſt. Alſo to vnderſtand it of the ſoule, that it reſts from the feeling of temptations to ſinne, and from feare of damnation, and yet to be in helliſh torments for ſinne, they not knowing how long. What a reſt may this be called? Let them ſhew where the word <hi>reſt</hi> is aſcribed to any, and that they are bleſſed and doe reſt, while they be in flaming torments? Thus the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 19. and 18. 18. Here is mention of the Churches power to looſe on earth; but not in Purgatorie, except Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie be on earth. Not <hi>Peter,</hi> nor the <hi>Pope</hi> hath any power al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Chriſt from theſe Scriptures, to meddle with any bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or looſing of any after death, but onely in this life. Note

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Albeit the fooliſh Gagger doth ſay that this is an expreſſe Scripture to proue Purgatorie: yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Purg. cap. 5.</note> that this is one of the moſt difficult places of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therefore it will not eaſily ſatisfie a doubtfull minde in this controuerted point.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this place is interpreted in the ſeuerall words very<note place="margin">See <hi>Morneus</hi> on the Maſſe: all their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cited, <hi>Lib. 3. cap. 6. p. 257, 261.</hi>
                     </note> diuerſly by the Ancients, and ſo variouſly, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by reaſon of the incongruities thereof, to leaue and forſake them all, and to run his owne courſe, as wide as any of the reſt, and differing from his fellowes, <hi>Thomas, Alcuinus, Hugo Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalis,</hi> and other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his Commentarie ſaith, that this place affordeth not any thing for Purgatorie, or veniall ſinnes. This his opinion is not ſuffered to ſee light, but is blotted out. See <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> which is made the true <hi>Purgatorie</hi> for <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and others that dare to doubt of the falſe Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the words are all Allegoricall. Now Symbolicall places proue not Articles of Faith. And therein it is abſurd to take any of the words properly in continued metaphors, and wholly Allegoricall.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, this text ſpeaketh of burning of a mans worke; but not of burning a ſoule. But in Purgatorie, they ſay, the ſoule is burning, and not his worke; workes goe not into Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie: but here workes both good and bad are tryed by this fire.</p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:1814:116"/>
                  <p>Sixtly, this ſpeaketh of the worke of Teachers, building vpon the foundation either Gold, Siluer, or precious Stones, or Wood, Hay, and Stubble. By the former muſt bee vnderſtood either ſound Doctrine, or ſound-hearted Beleeuers wonne to Chriſt by their teaching: and then by the latter muſt be meant errours, and vnſound Doctrine; or hollow-hearted Chriſtians, which in time of fierie tryall fall away. Take then either way, this is nothing for veniall ſinnes, or bringing ſoules to a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Accordingly in the thirteenth verſe, the fire is a reuealing and trying fire, to manifeſt the difference of mens workes in the execution of their Miniſterie. What is this to the purging and tormenting fire as a ſatisfactorie puniſhment for ſinne? Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie fire is a materiall fire, ſay they; but a materiall fire cannot try Doctrines, truth from falſhood, ſound from vnwholeſome teaching.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, the word fire in verſe 15. cannot be taken for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall fire, or Purgatorie fire.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the continued metaphors in the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text admits not of ſuch a proper and literall interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the word of ſimilitude is againſt it. For it is not ſaid, <hi>by fire,</hi> but <hi>as by fire;</hi> ſo it is not meant fire properly, but by ſome likeneſſe; a metaphoricall fire, not a materiall fire.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Eſtius</hi> one of their owne learned men, ſaith, That the word <hi>fire</hi> three times mentioned in verſe 13, and 15, is the ſame in euery place, and calleth the interpretation abſurd, which puts a difference in them. Which being true, the former fire in verſe 13. not being meant of Purgatorie, by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> grant, this latter cannot but abſurdly be ſo interpreted. And ſo in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, no Purgatorie fire at all.</p>
                  <p>This fire is ſpirituall, ſuch a fire as can try Doctrines, and can reueale them, and can ſaue the builder, though it conſume his worke, which fire is Gods Word, Ier. 23. 29. and 20. 9. and Gods holy Spirit, Mar. 9. 49. Mat. 3. 11. This word, by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Spirit vpon the conſcience of an erroneous buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when by the light of truth hee ſeeth his worke vaine and naught, worketh as fire in him to make him confeſſe his errour, and to labour to teach the truth, and thus is he ſaued, as by fire,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1814:117"/> the word being in him as fire, as it was in <hi>Ieremie,</hi> eſpecially in time of trouble, and day of tryall for his Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Ioh. 11. 22. <hi>But I know, that euen now, whatſoeuer thou wilt aske of God, God will giue it thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Gagger,</hi> hath hence learnedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that <hi>Martha</hi> had beene taught and beleeued, that the dead might be holpen by the pietie of the liuing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How learnedly the Cardinal could conclude hence Purgatorie, or the <hi>Gagger</hi> to helpe him, I leaue to learned men to iudge, and withal, whether they haue not expoſed themſelues to folly, who hence would collect ſuch a thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, touching the Iewiſh Church and her Doctrine, how Purgatorie was vnknowne to her and the Church of Iſrael vnder the Law, let the Reader peruſe <hi>Mornay</hi> of the Maſſe, his third booke, and ſixt Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the ſpeech is to Chriſt, and of her full aſſurance of the efficacie of his prayer vnto God, euen to raiſe vp <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> from the dead, as appeareth by the ſcope of her ſpeech. What is this to helpe ſoules in Purgatorie?</p>
                  <p>Act. 2. 24. <hi>Whom God hath raiſed vp, looſing the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of Hell.</hi> This cleerely makes for Purgatorie, ſaith the wiſe <hi>Gagger;</hi> for here he and the Rhemiſts wil haue Chriſt looſe others from their paines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This ſpeakes of Chriſts riſing from the dead by the power of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, of Gods raiſing him vp, and looſing him from the ſorrowes of Hell, and not of Chriſts freeing others from tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here is no mention of Purgatorie, but of Hell; And is Hell and Purgatorie now one place? I feare mee they will finde it ſo, that hee which goeth to Purgatorie, goeth to Hell.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the word <hi>Hell</hi> is here taken properly, or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely. If properly for hell it ſelfe, the place of the damned, then it is nothing for their Purgatorie: for from hell is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Luk. 16. 26. If figuratiuely, then it ſpeakes not of any reall Purgatorie place: and ſo neither way ſerues their turne.</p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:1814:117"/>
                  <p>Fiftly, if they will haue the place to bee for Purgatorie, then is there no cauſe now to feare it: for therein is now no more paines. For it is not ſaid, that hee looſed the ſoules out of it, but the ſorrowes thereof, and tooke them away. What maketh this for Purgatorie?</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the word in the moſt current originals is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (though the old vulgar reade <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) and the firſt ſignifieth not <hi>Hell,</hi> but <hi>Death,</hi> ſo it is thus to be read: <hi>looſing the ſorrowes of death,</hi> as we truely tranſlate.</p>
                  <p>1. Cor. 15. 29. <hi>Otherwiſe what ſhall they doe, that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed for the dead? An euident proofe ſaith the</hi> Gagger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Howſoeuer the profound wiſedome of the <hi>Gagger</hi> makes this euident, yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> graunts it to bee a darke Scripture; and there, indeed, is not a more obſcure text, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in moſt Expoſitors are to ſeeke, and hardly can finde to giue themſelues ſatisfaction herein: And therefore being in ſenſe darke and doubtfull, is not a ſufficient proofe in a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this ſo euident a place with the <hi>Gagger</hi> for Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, the Rhemiſts could not ſee to note it, nor <hi>Lyra,</hi> nor <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> nor <hi>Hugo de Sancto Charo</hi> a Cardinall, nor their Gloſſe, nor <hi>Caietan,</hi> much leſſe Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> nor <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> nor <hi>Haymo,</hi> nor other moe, ſome expounding it one way, ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but not of Purgatorie, nor of any ſuch thing as may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferre Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the ſcope of the place is to proue the Reſurrection of the dead, and not Purgatorie; for it is ſaid, <hi>If the dead riſe not at all, why are they baptized for the dead?</hi> Now, for them to expound <hi>baptized,</hi> afflicted; and afflicted, to ſignifie faſting and praying for the dead, and that for thoſe in Purgatorie, it is farre from prouing the Apoſtles ſcope, and the Reſurrection from the dead.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whatſoeuer the ſenſe of <hi>baptized for the dead</hi> may be; Firſt, it is cleare, that here by dead is vnderſtood the dead in graue, whoſe bodies were to riſe againe, and not of ſoules in Purgatorie. Secondly, if baptiſme here ſhould be afflicting, yet to bee baptized for the dead, is to bee taken not actiuely for
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1814:118"/> ſuch as baptize, that is, as our Aduerſaries here expound, doe afflict themſelues, but paſſiuely for ſuch to be afflicted by other. Thirdly, this reaſon, which the Apoſtle vſeth, ſeemeth to be ſuch a thing as was well knowne, and ſo forcible to perſwade to beleeue the Reſurrection, as the ſame words are in this one verſe twice mentioned. But how can our Aduerſaries proue that men, to afflict themſelues by faſting, &amp; prayer for the dead, was ſo well knowne and practiſed then in the Church? And yet if ſo, how proueth it the Apoſtles Doctrine, touching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, and the bodies of men to riſe out of the graue? or that therefore there is a Purgatorie? For the Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers mourned for <hi>Steuen,</hi> and made great lamentation ouer him, Act. 8. 2. yet proueth it not a Purgatorie, nor that <hi>Steuen</hi> was in it, being a Martyr, and the firſt of all other. Theſe three things let the <hi>Gagger</hi> proue, before he build his paper Purgatorie on this Text. Fiftly, the words <hi>for the dead</hi> may bee expounded for the hope of the Reſurrection of the dead, and the word <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> for afflicted; and ſo the words may bee thus read; Elſe what ſhall they doe which ſuffer and endure troubles in hope of the Reſurrection of the dead, if ſo be the dead doe not riſe at all? why are they then afflicted for this hope of the dead to riſe againe? Thus interpreted it is current enough, &amp; agreeable to the ſcope, and the next verſes 30, 31, 32. ſeeme to me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this expoſition. For the Apoſtle hauing ſaid, Why are they baptized? forth with he ſaith, <hi>Why ſtand wee in ieopardie euery houre?</hi> then he telleth of his <hi>dying dayly,</hi> and of his <hi>fighting with beaſts at Epheſus,</hi> and all vpon the hope of the Reſurrection, profeſſing all to be in vaine, &amp; no aduantage to him, <hi>if the dead riſe not at all.</hi> So as here the Apoſtle expoundeth the word <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> to be all one with, <hi>to ſtand in ieopardie, to dye dayly,</hi> and <hi>to fight with beaſts,</hi> and the words <hi>for the dead,</hi> his certaine hope of their riſing againe, which aduantageth him in enduring ſuch troubles and afflictions; elſe it were no matter to liue like Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, and then ſay, <hi>Let vs eate and drinke, for to morrow we ſhall dye.</hi> Thus this place vnderſtood remoueth obſcuritie, agreeth with the ſcope, hath warrant from the ſtile of the Apoſtle, is a ſtrong reaſon to perſwade, that the dead ſhall riſe againe, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1814:118"/> may ſatisfie the minde of him that ſeekes reſolution in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold varieties of expoſitions, as haue been hitherto made vpon this place.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 16. 9. <hi>Make you friends of the vnrighteous Mammon, that when you ſhallneed, they may receiue you into the euerlasting habitations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Rhemiſts looking on this place, found no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, but that Saints departed doe pray for vs. Which what is it to Purgatorie?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by <hi>they</hi> is to hee vnderſtood the Angels: by the euerlaſting habitations meant Heauen. How the <hi>Gagger</hi> could picke out Purgatorie hence, I ſee not. Surely hee had a great blazing Torch, bigger then all Purgatorie fire; elſe could hee not haue ſeene Purgatorie thorow this darke creuiſe.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 23. 42. <hi>Lord, remember mee when thou commeſt into thy Kingdome.</hi> Hence, ſaith he, the good thiefe preſuppoſed, that ſoules might be holpen after death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What then? <hi>Ergo,</hi> a Purgatorie? Proue this. For ſoules are holpen after death, when by the holy Angels they are carried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, Luk. 16. 22.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the good Thiefe prayeth here to Chriſt for ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him, as now he was in the world, and ready to die, and not through feare of Purgatorie to bee deliuered out of it. The <hi>Gagger</hi> muſt proue that he beleeued a Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſts anſwer cleereth this, for hee ſaid, <hi>This day ſhalt thou bee with mee in Paradiſe.</hi> Chriſt vnderſtood him to pray to goe to heauen, and not to bee holpen in Purgatorie, and therefore promiſeth him Heauen that day, whither he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe went.</p>
                  <p>2. Machab. 12. 46. <hi>It is therefore an holy and healthfull co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This is as it is in their Bible.</note> 
                     <hi>to pray for the dead, that they may bee looſed from ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This booke is Apocryphal, and ſo of no force to perſwade in a doubted point of faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is no word of Purgatorie, though we ſhould admit of the place.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in this Verſe (ſee <hi>Montanus</hi> his Bible) there is in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1814:119"/> the originall, no mention of praying for the dead, but of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, but to yeeld the tranſlation: What then? Praying for the dead proueth not Purgatorie. For the Greekes pray for the dead, and yet beleeue no Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, they prayed here for the pardon of ſinnes, and not for freedome out of Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the parties here prayed for, dyed in mortall ſinne, and were guilty of horrible idolatry forbidden by the Law, ver. 40. but ſuch as ſo dye, goe not to Purgatorie, it is a place for veniall, and not for mortall ſinners, as they teach.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, the mouing cauſe of their praying, and making an offering to ſend to Ieruſalem for a ſinne-offering, was, for that they were mindfull of the Reſurrection, verſe 44. and not that they thought theſe men to be in Purgatorie. This reſts to be proued.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, and laſtly, it is cleere, that the Author of this booke did not dreame of any Purgatorie: For hee maketh the ground of praying for the dead, onely the hope of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, affirming the act otherwiſe to be ſuperfluous &amp; vaine, verſe 44.</p>
                  <p>Tobie 4. 18. <hi>Set thy bread and thy wine vpon the buriall of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In ours, Chap. 4. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>the iuſt man: but doe not eate and drinke thereof with ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This booke is Apocryphal; and therefore of no ſuch credit as to end a Controuerſie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is not one word of Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, nor any mention of prayers for the dead, by which they inferre, though vnſoundly, Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this Feaſt was for the comfort of the liuing ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for the dead, as is cleere out of Ier. 16. 7. and not for any thing touching the ſoules departed.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the name of <hi>Iuſt man</hi> is againſt the conceit of being in Purgatorie; for the iuſt ſhall goe into life euerlaſting, Mat. 25. 46. The ſoules of the iuſt are in the hand of God, and torment ſhall not touch them, ſaith the booke of Wiſedome, chap. 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>Eſai. 4. 4. <hi>The Lord ſhall cleanſe the filth of the Daughters of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1814:119"/> Sion, and ſhall waſh the bloud of Ieruſalem out of the midſt thereof, in the ſpirit of iudgement, and ſpirit of heate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, theſe words are wholly Metaphoricall, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpoken, to be taken after the letter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he ſpeakes here not of veniall ſinnes, lyable to Purgatorie, but of mortall ſinnes ſet out vnder <hi>filth,</hi> and <hi>bloud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this cleanſing was to be in the midſt of Ieruſalem; was Purgatorie in it?</p>
                  <p>Eſai. 9. 18. <hi>For impietieis kindled as a fire, it ſhall deuoure Bryer and Thorne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This ſpeaketh not of Purgatorie, but of <hi>impietie,</hi> and the nature, thereof. But the <hi>Gagger</hi> did well to take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, for Purgatorie; for it is an impious conceit: and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie can as truely purge ſinne, as impietie it ſelfe, and both alike.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is not a ſpeaking of fire, but onely by way of ſimilitude, <hi>kindled as a fire;</hi> and not properly meant of any materiall fire.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they ſay, Purgatorie fire is but a purging, and not a deuouring fire; but here the Prophet ſpeakes of deuouring.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Purgatorie fire deuoures not Bryers and Thornes: and if they expound theſe of ſinnes, then are they not veniall, for bryers and thornes are the curſe on the earth: and therefore if they ſet out ſinnes, they muſt note out curſed ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the Prophet ſpeaketh of Gods wrath, which he would powre out againſt the people then aliue in thoſe dayes for their wickedneſſe, as the words before, from verſe 13. and after this text, verſe 19. doe euidently ſhew. Thus <hi>Ierome, Haymo,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take to be the meaning.</p>
                  <p>Math. 3. 11. <hi>Hee ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A man would iudge the <hi>Gagger</hi> a very Gooſe, in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this for Purgatorie: but that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> produced it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer: Firſt, if fire be here Purgatory, then Chriſt baptized with the holy Ghoſt, and with Purgatorie. Did he ſo?</p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:1814:120"/>
                  <p>Secondly, let them allegorize how they will, the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ariſing are ſo great, as no reaſonable iudgement will reſt thereupon. For almoſt euery thing in the text ouerthrowes this feigned Purgatorie priſon.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Agree.</hi> This being done, preuents going to this priſon of Purgatorie. For he is caſt in for not agreeing. But all the godly (who onely are ſubiect to goe into Purgatory, and not the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) haue made their agreement with God, by Chriſt, who hath ſatisfied for them, procured for them remiſſion of ſinnes, and made an atonement to God for them, Rom. 5. 10, 11. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this text, none that are in Chriſt, goe into this priſon: and ſo none at all: for the Reprobate goe to Hell. This Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie priſon is therefore a babiſh Bugbeare: a place for no body.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>With thine Aduerſarie.</hi> This is diuerſly expounded: but take it which way they will, it ſerues not for Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſome make him the <hi>Deuill:</hi> But with this Aduerſary we may not agree, but muſt euer, &amp;c. Iam. 4. 7. And what hath the Deuill to doe with Purgatorie?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſome ſay he is God. If ſo, Firſt, he is agreed with, as before is ſhewed, ſo as by him wee cannot be caſt into Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie iuſtly. Secondly, who is the Magiſtrate to whom God leadeth vs, Luk. 12. 58? Is any aboue God, that he needs to ſeeke iuſtice at the hands of another? Cannot hee right him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? Thirdly, but where reade we, that God is called an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie to his children? We reade the Deuill to be our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, 1. Pet. 5. and the man of ſinne, the Romiſh Antichriſt, 2. Theſ. 2. 4. but where is God ſo called? Fourthly, if hee be, in caſting of his into Purgatorie for their veniall ſinnes; then are veniall ſinnes iniurious to God: which they deny; but if they were not, God would be their Aduerſarie for ſuch ſinnes, not being reconciled, till they had made him ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſome make this Aduerſarie the <hi>Law:</hi> but if the law be he, then veniall ſinnes are the breach of the law, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mortall. For the law curſeth euery one that obeyeth not all things therein, Deut. 27. Neither doth the law ſend them to Purgatorie, but as accurſed to Hell. Yet can it not thus doe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1814:120"/> with ſuch as be in Chriſt; for hee was made vnder the Law, to redeeme vs from the curſe thereof, Gal. 4. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Quickly, whileſt thou art in the way with him.</hi> The <hi>way</hi> here is either good or bad. Not bad: for how can God (whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes this Aduerſarie) walke with him, that hee is an Aduerſarie to, in an ill way? If a good way, how is it that he and the offending partie ſhould continue at odds, and he be his Aduerſarie in a good way?</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>Lest at any time</hi> (to wit, in this life, being in the way) <hi>the Aduerſarie deliuer thee to the Iudge.</hi> Who may this Iudge be? Betweene God and vs there is no Vmpire or Dayes-man, Iob 9. 33. Chriſt indeed is Iudge; but firſt hee ſits not yet to iudge, but at the laſt Day; as yet hee ſits to make interceſſion for his people to God, to reconcile God to them. Secondly, when Chriſt is Iudge, he ſhall reward all the godly, he deliuers them not to the Gaoler, as the Iudge here doth. And thirdly, this Aduerſarie deliuers the offender to this Iudge to bee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: but God the Father drawes ſuch as he will ſaue, to Chriſt: Chriſt therefore is not this Iudge. And who he may be elſe, let the <hi>Gagger</hi> tell vs: for other Iudge of men before God there is none, after this life.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>And the Iudge deliuer thee to the Gaoler or Officer.</hi> In this Allegorie, the Iudge is laſt; except they will ſay it is conſcience. But will God deliuer his ſeruants ouer to the worme of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at their death? This were to ſend them, not to Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but to Hell, where this worme dyeth not. And if the Iudge be Conſcience, I pray them tell vs, who then is the Officer ſubiect to Conſcience? If they ſay, The Officer is the Deuill, or ſome one of his wicked angels: who can beleeue it? For will either God, or Chriſt permit Deuils to carry ſoules to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie? Or is it ſome good Angell? Good Angels carrie ſoules into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, Luk. 16. 22. and not into Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie. And they are miniſtring ſpirits for the good of thoſe that bee heires of ſaluation, Heb. 2. 14. and not Gaolers to caſt the godly into fierie torments. As the Iudge is loſt in this Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie; ſo the Officer or Gaoler for this Purgatorie priſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1814:121"/>VI. <hi>And thou be cast into priſon.</hi> Here is the puniſhment for non-agreement. This priſon, ſay they, is Purgatorie: but that cannot be.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe in the whole New Teſtament, it is taken either properly for a place for Malefactors here, Act. 12. or elſe for hell, 1. Pet. 3. 10. Reu. 20. 7. No where for Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they that goe to Purgatorie, are the Penitent, ſay they, but the offending partie caſt into this priſon, is one that will not agree with his Aduerſarie, but forceth him to ſhew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, and ſo is he obſtinate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this partie is iniurious to God, in making him an Aduerſarie, in obſtinate perſiſting, and he is much offended, in that hee cauſeth him to bee <hi>cast</hi> into priſon: an act expreſſing anger, Math. 25. 30. Now, ſay they, obſtinate offenders ſinne not venially, neither is veniall ſinne iniurious to God, as they ſay. Therefore this priſon cannot be Purgatorie, into which ſuch an offender is caſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. <hi>Thou ſhalt not come out thence, till thou haſt paid the vtmoſt farthing.</hi> Theſe words ſhew that this priſon cannot bee Purgatorie. For <hi>till</hi> here is neuer, as in other Scriptures, Math. 1. 25. Numb. 20. 17. Pſal. 110. 1. Luk. 22. 16, 18. 1. Sam. 15. 35. <hi>Till thou haſt paid,</hi> imply not that the man can pay, or that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in priſon, he doth pay, as our Aduerſaries dreame. For going into priſon, argueth inabilitie to pay, Mat. 18. and lying in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is no payment, but rather a puniſhment for not paying. As for theſe words, <hi>the vtmoſt farthing,</hi> argue not, as fooliſhly our Aduerſaries doe imagine, that the party lyeth here onely for farthings, to which they compare veniall ſinnes, as if he had made payment of greater ſummes, but had not ſatisfied for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, when here is no mention of paying any part of the debt, greater or leſſer, and the <hi>vtmoſt farthing</hi> is named, not to imply paiment of any part, or to make a difference of leſſer moneys from greater ſummes, or as they ſpeake of veniall ſins from mortall, but to ſhew the extremitie whereto the debter ſhall be brought, before he be freed from priſon. Here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then for venial ſinues, more then to imagine that this deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ought a ſumme of money all of farthings onely, or that hee
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1814:121"/> had agreed with his Aduerſarie for pounds, ſhillings, and pence: but now would bee ſo froward as to ſtand out for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, and for theſe to be caſt into priſon, of which to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man there is no likelihood. Thus we ſee how in all the words, the Allegorie, to proue their Purgatory, is wholly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne: ſo as this place muſt needs bee taken properly, and nothing at all ſerues for their purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>2. Tim. 1. 18. <hi>The Lord grant vnto him that he may find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Lord in that Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Gagger</hi> citeth this for Purgatorie; but how hee can hence proue it, I ſee not. <hi>In that Day,</hi> is the laſt Day. And muſt an <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> a man of ſuch rare mercies, goe to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie?</p>
                  <p>1. Ioh. 5. 16. <hi>If any man ſee his brother ſinne a ſinne not vnto death, he ſhall aske, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is no word of Purgatorie, but mention of ſome ſinne to death, and other ſome not to death, as are the ſinnes of infirmitie, committed by Gods Elect. What is this to proue a Purgatorie? Thus much for the obiected Scriptures in defence of their <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> as one well calleth it.</p>

                  <p>I. IT concludeth all, euen the beſt that euer were, vnder ſinne, 1. Ioh. 1. 8, 10. If <hi>we</hi> ſay, <hi>we</hi> haue no ſinne, <hi>wee</hi> deceiue our ſelues. <hi>Iohn</hi> includes himſelfe. Rom. 3. 23. <hi>All</hi> haue ſinned, Eſai. 53. 6. <hi>All</hi> we like ſheepe haue gone aſtray: on him is the iniquitie of vs <hi>all.</hi> 1. King. 8. 46. There is <hi>no man</hi> that ſinneth not. Iam. 3. 2. In many things <hi>we</hi> offend <hi>all. Iames</hi> includes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and all to whom he wrote this generall Epiſtle. Pro. 20. 9. Who can ſay, My heart is cleane, I am pure from ſinne? None
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1814:122"/> but Ieſus Chriſt onely, and he alone, Hebr. 4. 15. 1. Ioh. 3. 5. 1. Pet. 2. 22. 2. Cor. 5. 21. Therefore where ſinne is, there is a ſtaine of all our actions; and ſo cannot bee meritorious, or cauſe of ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it teacheth vs, that we are like a dead man in ſinnes, Epheſ. 2. 1, 5. Col. 2. 13. ſo as our wils are not to doe good, till God make vs willing, as in the next Propoſition, I ſhall fully ſhew. Now where mans owne will is wanting, till by another it be made willing, his workes cannot merit. For a meritorious worke muſt come of mans free-will.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it teacheth that all our goodneſſe without vs and within vs, is of Gods grace; <hi>By the grace of God, I am that I am,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 15. 10. It is of his goodneſſe, Rom. 11. 22. of his benignitie and kindneſſe, Tit. 3. 4. and of his good will, Phil. 2. 13. 2. Tim. 1. 12. that we are conuerted. Now, if all that which we doe, either doing good workes, or ſuffering for his name, 1. Chron. 29. 12, 14, 16. Phil. 2. 29. be of God, and that of his meere grace, mercy, benignitie, and good will; how can man doe a good worke to merit at Gods hands? For a worke that merits, muſt be our owne; but what haue we that we haue not receiued, 1. Cor. 4. 7? Who hath firſt giuen to him, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution ſhall be made of him, Rom. 11. 35? In the meane ſpace we doe giue to God onely of his owne, 1. Cor. 29. 12, 14, 16. Deut. 8. 18. And profit we him any thing thereby? He is not the better by vs, Pſal. 16. 2. What hee willeth vs to doe, is not for his good, but for our owne, that hee in mercy might doe vs good, Deut. 5. 29.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it teacheth vs, that though we in ſtate of grace, be thus furniſhed of God, and hereby made willing and able to doe that which is good and well-pleaſing, through Chriſt, in his ſight: yet are we not in this life able perfectly to fulfill the Law of God: <hi>Adam</hi> once could; in heauen hereafter we may, but here it is not poſſible. For in Eccl. 7. 21. it is ſaid, <hi>There is no iuſt man in the earth that doth good, and ſinneth not.</hi> All the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the godly witneſſe the truth hereof, and euery mans owne experience, and euery mans owne conſcience, if it bee not dead, or ſeared. For the obedience required, is not onely exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1814:122"/> but ſpirituall and internall alſo, and this abſolutely in all perfection to be performed, to all the commandements gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to euery commandement particularly, &amp; to euery branch of euery of them, at all times, without the leaſt omiſſion. But this obedience is impoſſible to be performed of any in this life; for that there is both fleſh and Spirit in euery man, which two are ſuch aduerſaries one to another, ſo as the beſt men cannot do the things which they would, Galat. 5. 17. This inability, through this corruption, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> found and confeſſed to be euen in himſelfe, Rom. 7. 15, 19. Therefore all our obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imperfect, our workes cannot bee meritorious, and cauſe of ſaluation. Merit requireth perfection, and admits not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; for curſed is euery one that keepeth not the words of the Law, and fulfilleth them not in workes, Deut. 27. 26. So far is man from meriting, as a malediction is due, if hee doe not obey the commandements, Deut. 11. 28.</p>
                  <p>V. It teacheth vs, that therefore through this our defect, good workes are ſecluded from being the meritorious cauſe of our ſaluation, 2. Tim. 1. 9. Epheſ. 2. 8, 9. <hi>By grace you are ſaued through faith; not of workes, that no man glory,</hi> Rom. 4. 2. <hi>If</hi> Abraham <hi>was iuſtified by workes, hee had to glory, but not with God.</hi> None are cleane before him, Iob 25. 4, 5, 6. &amp; 9. 2, 3. Rom. 3. 28. &amp; 9. 16. <hi>Wee account a man to be iuſtified by faith, without the workes of the Law. It is not of the willer, nor of the runner, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> Pſal. 48. 8, 9. <hi>Hee ſhall not</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In ours, Pſal. 49. 8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>giue vnto God his reconciliation, and the price of the Redemption of his owne ſoule.</hi> Therefore good workes, though they euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie thoſe that are ſaued, and iuſtified in Chriſt, as fruits of a liuely faith, yet are not the cauſe of ſaluation, nor doe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie vs before God.</p>
                  <p>VI. It teacheth, that God therefore, to make vs accepted, gaue vs his Sonne to become all in all for vs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hee was made vnder the Law, to redeeme vs from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, Gal. 4. 4, 5. Secondly, hee was made a curſe for vs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs from the curſe, Gal. 3. 43. Thirdly, he was wounded for our iniquities, and broken for our ſinnes, Eſai. 53. 5. by whoſe ſtripes we are healed, 2. Pet. 2. 24. Fourthly, hee himſelfe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1814:123"/> bare our ſinnes in his bodie vpon the tree, 1. Pet. 2. 24. making Purgatorie for ſinnes, Heb. 1. 3. and ſo for vs was made ſinne, that we might be made the iuſtice of God in him, 2. Cor. 5. 21. and ſo liue to iuſtice, 1. Pet. 2. 24. Fiftly, hereby hee is become our Wiſedome, Iuſtice, Sanctification and Redemption, 1. Cor. 1. 30. that we may glory in him, verſe 31. for in him the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God through faith is ours, Rom. 10. 3. and 3. 22. and ſo there can be to vs no condemnation being in Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee is our merit and cauſe of ſaluation, and not our owne workes.</p>
                  <p>VII. It teacheth, that the Apoſtle hereupon maketh mans bleſſedneſſe to conſiſt, not in his owne merits and workes, but in reputing iuſtice without workes, and in forgiuing, and not imputing ſinne, Rom. 4. 6, 7, 8. which forgiuing is our keeping of the Law. For as Saint <hi>Auſtin in retract. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 19. ſaith, <hi>All the commandements are holden to be kept, when that which is not kept is forgiuen.</hi> And againe, All our righteouſneſſe (ſaith he) ſtands rather in the remiſſion of our ſinnes, then in any perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of iuſtice, <hi>De ciu. Dei, lib. 19. cap.</hi> 27. Therefore if mans obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and keeping be in forgiueneſſe, and his bleſſedneſſe ſtand therein without workes, how is it poſſible to imagine, workes to be the meritorious cauſe of our ſaluation?</p>
                  <p>VIII. It teacheth that, for all the graces in vs, and for all our obedience to him, God onely promiſeth to be mercifull, as in Deut. 7. 9. Thou ſhalt know that the Lord thy God, hee is a ſtrong and a faithfull God, keeping his Couenant and <hi>mercy to them that loue him, and to them that keepe his precepts.</hi> So in Exo. 20. 6. Doing mercy to them that loue him and keepe his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. Here both for the inward loue of God, and outward obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is onely promiſed mercy. Now where mercy needeth, there can be no merit, Rom. 11. 6.</p>
                  <p>IX. It teacheth, that the godly 1. acknowledge in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie their ſinnes, Pſal. 51. 3, 4. Eſdr. 9. 6. Dan. 9. 1. Secondly, they vilifie themſelues, Iob 9. 2, 3, 30, 31. and 42. 6. 1. Cor. 4. 4. and alſo thoſe things which ſeeme to be of worth in them. We, ſaith the Prophet, are become as one vncleane, and all our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices as the cloth of a menſtruous woman, Eſa. 64. 6. Thirdly,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1814:123"/> they confeſſe, that if God be ſtrict in iuſtice, none can bee able<note place="margin">In ours, Pſal. 130. 3.</note> to indure, Pſal. 129. 3. If thou ſhalt obſerue iniquities, O Lord, Lord, who ſhall ſuſtaine it? Fourthly, hereupon they craue that God would not enter into iudgement with them, for that ſo no fleſh ſhould bee iuſtified in his ſight, Pſal. 142. 2. Fiftly, they<note place="margin">In ours, Pſal. 143. 2.</note> therefore appeale from his iuſtice, to his mercy, calling and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, as in Pſal. 129. 3. With thee there is propitiation: and<note place="margin">Pſal. 130. 3. Pſal. 51. 1.</note> ſaying alſo in Pſal. 50. 1. Haue mercy on me, O God, according to thy great mercy, giuing a reaſon, Dan. 9. 18. For not in our iuſtifications doe wee proſtrate prayers before thy face, but in thy many commiſerations. And therefore ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 118. 76. Let thy mercy be done to comfort mee. Hee ſeeketh comfort in mercy, and not in merit. Did theſe holy people of God dreame of merit, and of the worth of their workes, as the proud condemned Phariſe did, Luk. 18? or rather did they not as the poore Publican did, who cryed, Lord, haue mercy on me a ſinner? and therefore went away more iuſtified then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The godly know, if that they ſhould iuſtifie themſelues, their owne mouthes would condemne them, Iob 9. 20. And all are by Chriſt, Matth. 6. taught in Prayer, to fly to God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and to begge forgiueneſſe, and not to plead merit.</p>
                  <p>X. It teacheth, that all whatſoeuer God did to Iſrael his people, all was of his mercy, Pſal. 135. The poſſeſſion of the<note place="margin">Pſal 136.</note> Land of Canaan was not merited by Gods people, Deut. 9. 5. For, ſaith God, <hi>Not becauſe of thy iuſtices, and equitie of thy heart doeſt thou enter in to poſſeſſe thy lands: I doe it not for your ſake, be it knowne vnto you, ſaith the Lord, but for my holy name.</hi> So in Ezech. 36. 22, 32. Now, if the type of heauen could not bee me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by either inward grace, or outward workes, may we think that heauen may be merited, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels vs, that it is the gift of God, Rom. 6. 23? Gift is free, and not purchaſed.</p>
                  <p>XI. It teacheth, that the paſſions of this time are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne to the glory to come, Rom. 8. 18. If perſecution and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Martyrdome cannot merit condignely the glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: What may wee thinke of other workes whatſoeuer? For neither our goods, nor goodneſſes, is any thing vnto God, Pſal. 16. 2.</p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:1814:124"/>
                  <p>XII. It teacheth, that no man can merit of God, by doing that which he ought to doe; but rather, when wee haue done all things that are commanded, to iudge our ſelues vnprofitable ſeruants, Luk. 17. 10. But whatſoeuer we doe in obedience to God, the ſame we ought to doe, and that with all our minde, heart, ſoule, and ſtrength, Matth. 22. and therefore cannot me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by dutie, no more then a man can merit by paying his debts. This it is, which made Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay that he had nothing to glory of, when he did but his duty, 1. Cor. 9. 16.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is altogether needleſſe to conceit of merit. For what would we merit? Is it pardon of ſinne? or fauour of God? or life euerlaſting, life and heauen it ſelfe? Then theſe need not bee merited.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, Chriſt hath by his bloud cleanſed vs of all our ſinnes, 1. Ioh. 1. 7. God through him hath pardoned all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Col. 2. 13. Epheſ. 1. 7. Act. 13. 38. and ſo are wee healed, 1. Pet. 2. 24.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt hath reconciled vs to God, Rom. 5. 10, 11. and ſo haue we peace with him through Chriſt, Rom. 5. 1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt hath gotten vs full aſſurance of Heauen, by the ſureſt way that may be: for it is ours both by purchaſe, Heb. 9. 12. by donation, Ioh. 10. 28. and alſo by inheritance, Rom. 8. 17. Gal. 4. 7. and 3. 29. So as our obedience, and ſeruice, and works are done, not to merit eternall life, but rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our thankefulneſſe for thoſe things which he hath done for vs.</p>
                  <p>It is with vs, as with a man once very rich and wealthy vnder<note place="margin">Simile.</note> a great Landlord, whoſe Tenant 1. hath runne himſelfe out of all, and turned Bankerupt: 2. is become infinitely in debt, and not able to pay: 3. is at laſt caſt into priſon, there to lye and dye for any meanes poſſible, either by himſelfe, or any of his friends to ſet him free. Now, the ſonne of this his great Landlord is ſo exceeding full of compaſſion and loue, that of meere pitty, without any ſuite or deſert of the partie impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned: Firſt, goeth and payeth all the debt to the vtmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſatisfying all to the full, &amp; ſo freeth him of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, then he purchaſeth again his Lands, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1814:124"/> them for the poore Tenants vſe and benefit, as before, and maketh them ſure to him againe by word and writing, ſealed and deliuered before witneſſes. Thirdly, he furniſheth him with moneyes to ſet him on worke, and to manage this his eſtate as long as hee liueth: So as he becommeth hereby rich. Now, what is this man to doe with theſe his moneys, and with honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereof? Is he to pay his debts therewith? They bee paid already. Is he to purchaſe his Lands againe, &amp; to redeeme them therewith? They are purchaſed to his hand. What is hee then to doe? By the Law of gratitude, hee is onely to expreſſe his thankefulneſſe, by ſhewing himſelfe obliged to him in all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable duties for euer, to loue him vnfeinedly, feare to offend him at any time, and to be euer ready at his command; and not, like a proud arrogant dotard, to endeuour with this his friends moneys to make needleſſe payments, &amp; purchaſes, as if he ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be beholding to ſuch a friend, as had done already all theſe things for him. This tenant is <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">Application.</note> who loſt Paradiſe, and all his right of heauen and earth, and by his ſinnes to God became infinitely indebted, and ſo is caſt into the kingdome of darkneſſe vnrecouerably, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any power of any naturall man to redeeme him. But Chriſt Ieſus he comes, by his death payes his debts, &amp; by his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience purchaſeth him the right of heauen and earth againe. This he aſſureth him of by his word, writing the couenant in his heart: then giueth he him his Spirit, the ſeale of that inheritance, and ſo thereupon the comfort of conſcience to be witnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Then doth he beſtow vpon him manifold gifts and graces to adorne his profeſſion, to glorifie Chriſt, and to allure other to his ſeruice, to ſtop the mouthes of wicked blaſphemers, to inable him the better to doe Chriſts ſeruice, and to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thankful, &amp; not to ſtriue vaine-gloriouſly to make himſelfe copurchaſer with Chriſt, and that not with any thing of his owne, but with Chriſts owne gifts and graces. Theſe former ends we Proteſtants onely ayme at, and doe reſt with our Lord and Sauiours purchaſe moſt thankefully. This latter the proud Phariſaicall Papiſts ſtriue vnto, as if Chriſts paiment and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1814:125"/> were inſufficient without their helpe, and yet without Chriſts bounty, are beggerly wretches. This their pride, ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and derogation from Chriſts goodneſſe towards them, doe deſerue damnation.</p>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1814:125"/> ground of ſaluation, then the free election of grace, Epheſ. 1. 4, 5. Rom. 11. 5, 6. Act. 13. 48.</p>

                  <p>Matth. 16. 27. <hi>Hee ſhall reward euery man according to his workes.</hi> Matth. 5. 12. <hi>Great is your reward in Heauen.</hi> So Matth. 10. 42. Rom. 2. 6. 1. Cor. 3. 8. Reuel. 22. 12. Ierem. 31. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is, Rom. 4. 4. a reward of mercy and grace, which we acknowledge, and not of deſert and merit: for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward may be of bounty aboue any due to the partie, but ſo cannot merit. <hi>Ambroſe Epiſt. lib.</hi> 1. There is one kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of liberalitie and grace; and another the wages of vertues and recompence of labours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the reward here being vnderſtood of eternall life, muſt needs be of mercy; for eternall life, ſaith the Apoſtle, is the gift of God, Rom. 6. 23. and not mans purchaſe. A gift is free, and cannot be merited by workes: for to him that works, the reward is reckoned not of grace, but of debt, Rom. 4. 4. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then being Gods gift, cannot bee due for workes, to make God become indebted to man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Rewarder here is God. Now, he rewards two wayes, either in meere iuſtice, or in iuſtice and mercy both. In meere iuſtice ſo rewardeth he the wicked, iuſtly deſeruing dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. In iuſtice and mercy both: ſo beleeuers in Chriſt. In iuſtice firſt, in reſpect of Chriſts meriting reward for his: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for that God is iuſt in his promiſe, and hauing promiſed a reward in his iuſtice, he will performe it. In mercy yet this is to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1814:126"/> vs: firſt, in reſpect of our ſelues, deſeruing no ſuch reward: then, in reſpect of the mouing cauſe, which is his owne good pleaſure, to make ſuch a promiſe, and to accept vs in Chriſt, and ſo to reward vs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the reward here is promiſed to the perſons, <hi>He will reward euery man,</hi> and not the worke: for the perſon makes the worke accepted, as <hi>Abel</hi> did his offering, and not the worke the<note place="margin">Gen. 4. Heb. 11.</note> perſon with God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is not here ſaid, <hi>for his workes,</hi> as noting any cauſe of mans reward, but <hi>according to his workes,</hi> ſhewing the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the works, as they may excell one another, and how our workes ſhould be the meaſure, according to which God would mete and proportion out the heauenly rewards. For as men here excell in vertues, ſo ſhall they in glory; and therefore of ſuch as ſuffer for Chriſt, hee ſaith, <hi>Great is your reward,</hi> Matth. 5.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, if workes were rewarded, yet is it in mercy, and not for the merit of them: for are they not imperfect, as before is proued? Againe, are they not his owne, fruits of his owne Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? and can wee merit to giue to God his owne? Moreouer, what equalitie is there betweene heauen, the reward, and the worke wrought? None at all. And therefore the reward is in mercy, and not in merit.</p>
                  <p>2. Cor. 5. 10. <hi>Wee muſt all appeare before the Iudgement Seat of Chriſt, that euery one may receiue the things done in his bodie, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is intended onely, that in generall there ſhall be a retribution of reward and puniſhment. And therefore the diuers meane of procuring both theſe is not ſpecified: but a phraſe vſed, which may extend to both, <hi>according to that he hath done,</hi> in either kinde. Otherwiſe for the one, namely, for doing badly, might truely, &amp; properly haue bin ſaid, For the merit, or demerit of euill workes, puniſhment is due. But becauſe it could not be ſaid ſo of the other, therefore the word <hi>according</hi> is vſed. And ſo the ſcope of the place reacheth onely to ſhew, that there ſhall be a manifeſtation of our workes, and retribution for them. But if we will needs particularize here of the manner
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1814:126"/> of rewarding good workes, then wee ſay, that the Iudge here, Ieſus Chriſt, comes not to reward his, according to their merit, with heauen: for it is ſaid, that hee <hi>giueth</hi> to them eternall life, Ioh. 10. 28. By his bloud himſelfe obtained it for them, Heb. 9. 12. They doe not then merit that which is gift: and therefore he proceeds not here according to any merit in them.</p>
                  <p>1. Cor. 4. 5. <hi>Then ſhall euery man haue praiſe of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no merit ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the perſon is praiſed, and not his workes: and this God doth of his goodneſſe, for our faithfulneſſe, Matth. 25. 21, 23. but not for the worthineſſe of the worke done.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> verſe 4. the very next verſe before ſaith, <hi>Though I know nothing by my ſelfe, yet am I not thereby iustified.</hi> He conceited therefore no merit.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the praiſe here intended ſpecially, is in regard of ſinceritie of teaching, whereby Saint <hi>Paul</hi> implyeth, that other falſe and proud teachers were not ſo praiſe-worthy, as ſome of the Corinthians thought, being ſeduced by them.</p>
                  <p>1. Cor. 9. 17, 18. <hi>I haue a reward,</hi> verſe 25.</p>
                  <p>They ſtriue to obtaine an incorruptible Crowne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This reward is of mercy, and not of merit: for the incorruptible Crowne, that is, Heauen, is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Chriſt, and is his gift to vs: therefore not obtained by merit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our obtaining by ſtriuing, is the obtaining of the aſſurance of the Crowne in our ſelues, and not the obtaining of the Crowne it ſelfe through the worthineſſe of the ſtriuing: ſeeing we are commanded to ſtriue, Luk. 13. 24. Now, that which is done of duty, cannot merit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle <hi>firſt,</hi> in verſe 16. telleth vs, that in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his dutie, he hath nothing to glory of: Then in verſe 17. he applyeth the reward, not to the worke wrought, but to his willingneſſe in working: yet he implyeth, that there may be an vnwillingneſſe: and doth hee not acknowledge, Rom. 7. 18. that where a will is, yet there may want abilitie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme?</p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:1814:127"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, in verſe 18. hee plainely expreſſes what hee meaneth there by reward; not heauen, but in preaching, to make the Goſpell of Chriſt without charge.</p>
                  <p>Hebr. 11. 26. <hi>He had reſpect to the recompence of reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The blundering Friers, whereſoeuer they finde in Scripture, <hi>reward,</hi> preſently cry out that they haue found <hi>merit.</hi> How oft haue we told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the ancient Fathers, nay, out of ciuil experience, that reward &amp; merit be not alwaies Relatiues? that there is a reward of grace as well as of due debt, Rom. 4. 4?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, who knowes not, but that euen here men requite labours without deſert?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Moſes</hi> had reſpect to the recompence vpon Gods promiſe made, and not vpon the merit of his owne doing: for hee makes not his owne act, the procurer of the recompence, but the certainty of the recompence, the ſetter of him forward to the worke.</p>
                  <p>Pſal. 18. 20. <hi>The Lord rewarded mee according to my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. 1. Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh in his life time of that which God had done for him in deliuering him from <hi>Saul,</hi> and from his enemies, which dealt moſt vniuſtly with him: here therefore firſt <hi>Dauids</hi> righteouſneſſe is his righteouſneſſe towards men, which God mercifully looked vpon, and not any righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his before God: for this <hi>Dauid</hi> diſclaimed, Pſal. 130. 3. and 143. 2. Secondly, the reward here is not heauen, but <hi>Dauids</hi> deliuerance, and Gods fauourable protection of him in his troubles.</p>
                  <p>Reuel. 3. 4. <hi>For they are worthy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is ſpoken of the perſons, and not of their workes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the word <hi>worthy,</hi> is here indeterminately ſet downe, and doth not ſhew how they are worthy. Therefore before it bee determined, it muſt bee proued by other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, how they became worthy: elſe merit cannot hence bee concluded.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, men by the Goſpell are worthy, not of themſelues, but through Chriſt, who is their righteouſneſſe before God,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1814:127"/> 1. Cor. 1. 30. Worthy they were, becauſe Chriſt was pleaſed to count them worthy, as 2. Theſ. 1. 5.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this may be vnderſtood comparatiuely, in reſpect of others in <hi>Sardis,</hi> who had defiled themſelues, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Digni, non ex dignitate, ſed dignatione.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Col. 2. 24. <hi>Knowing that ye ſhall receiue the reward of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; for yee ſerue the Lord Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here the Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſeruants, how in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faithfully their ſeruice to men, they ſerue Chriſt himſelfe. Now, for ſeruants to ſerue their Maſter faithfully, is a duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, Epheſ. 6. 5, 6. But impoſed duties done, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not merit, Luk. 17. 10. 1. Cor. 9. 16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the word <hi>for</hi> expreſſeth not the cauſe of the reward: but the ſigne and true token to our ſelues of obtaining it. It no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the qualitie and condition of ſuch as may looke for eternall life; as alſo the way and order, which they that come thereto, doe obſerue here in this life, and not the cauſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>Gen. 15. <hi>I am thy great reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is ſpoken of God himſelfe. Can he himſelfe be merited of vs? Can man by any worke bring God himſelfe to bee the very due debt? I tremble to thinke ſo. Let any Phariſe thus challenge God: I dare not.</p>
                  <p>1. Tim. 4. 8. <hi>Godlineſſe hath promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That which is of promiſe, commeth freely, and is not merited. God promiſed Chriſt. Did we merit him? Chriſt promiſed his holy Spirit. Was it merited?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, all promiſes of God made to his people, are made in Chriſt. In him all the promiſes of God are yea, and Amen; they haue their ground and performance in him, and for his ſake, to vs. This very word cutteth the ſinewes of Merit, and ſheweth that we claime of God fidelitie in performing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but not the paiment of a deſerued debt.</p>
                  <p>2. Tim. 4. 8. <hi>The Crowne of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord that righteous Iudge ſhall giue me at that day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Before is ſhewed how eternall life, which is this Crowne of righteouſneſſe, is giuen vs freely by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is called the Crowne of righteouſneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1814:128"/> he glorifieth thus thoſe whom hee iuſtifieth, Rom. 8. 30.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> diſclaimed iuſtification by his owne righteouſneſſe, 1. Cor. 4. 4. &amp; 9. 16. and taught ſaluation to bee by grace, and not by workes, Epheſ. 2. Here therefore hee ſpeakes not of merit: for ſo ſhould hee be contrarie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in verſe 7. of nothing done by him, but that which by dutie hee was bound to doe. Was hee not bound to fight a good fight, to finiſh his courſe, and to keepe the faith? Then could hee not merit by his dutie, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is proued.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Lord is ſaid to bee righteous in rewarding, not in reſpect either of vs, or of our worke, but in reſpect of his promiſe to reward, which he is iuſt to performe: for by our workes we make him not debter; but he makes himſelfe ſo of his meere goodneſſe by promiſing, for hee is not vniuſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our works, Heb. 6. 10. for his owne promiſe ſake: for hee is iuſt in his ſayings, Rom. 3. 4. Where note alſo, that the truth of God, verſe 7. is called the righteouſneſſe of God, verſe 5. and he is ſaid to be iuſt, as well in forgiuing, 1. Ioh. 1. 9. as in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing: and a mercifull righteouſneſſe there is in God, euen his faithfulneſſe towards his people, in performance of his Word, which is oppoſed to the iuſtice of God, by which hee rewards men according to their deſerts, Pſal. 143. 1, 21. Conſider this well, and thou ſhalt neuer ſwell with merit.</p>
                  <p>2. Theſ. 1. 5. <hi>That yee may bee counted worthy of the Kingdome of God, for which reſuffer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Touching the word <hi>worthy:</hi> ſee before the anſwer to Reu. 3. 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here it is not ſaid, that they <hi>are worthy,</hi> or <hi>might be worthy,</hi> but, that they <hi>may be counted worthy.</hi> Now, to be ſo, and to be counted ſo, doe much differ. For they bee counted ſo, that in themſelues are not ſo, but in another, as wee all bee through Chriſt. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth to God for this, as a mercy from him, towards them, that hee would count them worthy. Now, God doth count none worthy but in Chriſt, in whom onely hee is pleaſed, Matth. 3. 17. Therefore the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1814:128"/> were not worthy by any thing in themſelues. Thirdly, their ſufferings made them not worthy of eternall life: for the Apoſtle had taught the contrary, Rom. 8. 18.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>XXIX. Propoſition.</hi> Of Free-will, and the ſtrength thereof.</head>
               <p>BEfore I come to propound the queſtion, that it may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtood, ſomethings are to be premiſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there is the facultie called the will in euery reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this will is a free and actiue will, in it ſelfe, and to anything it willeth, without enforcement.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that this will hath the vnderſtanding, the other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of the ſoule, euer going before it, to bee the informer thereof.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that this will hath power to chuſe, or refuſe the thing obiected, and laid before it, or to pauſe and reſt it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that the vſe of this free-will was, to compaſſe all thoſe ends for which man was made, (which were as manifold as mans compoſition, who is <hi>microcoſmus</hi>) and to doe ſuch things as ſhould tend to his owne good, and Gods glory: but by ſinning, man hath left off this free-will, till it be repaired by grace: yet not wholly, but that in diuers things ſome power remaineth;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>in all naturall actions,</hi> as to eate, ſleepe, walke, ſit, ſtand, and to vſe all other bodily actions, and vſe of the ſenſes, for preſeruation of life, and for auoiding things hurtfull; the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gift in nature, common to all vnreaſonable creatures. Onely whereas theſe moue to their end, yet are they not priuy (for want of reaſon) to diſcerne what they doe: but man, as Lord of his owne actions, doth what he doth, out of his owne choice, by knowledge, and deliberation before hand.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>in humane actions;</hi> as to ſpeake, diſcourſe, learne and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1814:129"/> teach Arts and Sciences, and all ſuch things as bee common to all of mankinde, that they may liue in the world, as men, among men, in ciuill ſocieties profitably.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>in Morall actions;</hi> as to doe iuſtice, to liue tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, chaſtely, to doe good to others, to relieue, helpe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, and to doe actions of common honeſtie, and ſuch things as be praiſe-worthy, and common among ciuill-minded men, which know how to gouerne themſelues after a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable faſhion in well-ordered ſocieties: but yet all theſe with great weakeneſſe, and maimedly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>in ſinfull actions,</hi> euen to the full, and that with greedineſſe, Epheſ. 4. 19. as to blaſpheme, deſpiſe Religion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the truth, and to doe all manner of euill, drawing ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie in cords of vanity, and ſinne, as the linke of a Waine, Eſa. 5. 18. as farre as God will permit.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>in outward meanes tending to ſpirituall ends:</hi> by Gods appointment, as to come to the Church, to ſay prayers, to reade and preach the Word, to heare it read and preached, to receiue the Sacraments, to conferre and reaſon of points of Religion, to profeſſe it openly, to ſubmit, and outwardly to conforme to the orders of the Church; and to obſerue ſuch things therein, as be common to the outward profeſſion of Chriſtianitie. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the power of the will is wonderous weake and defectiue, as is cleere by too lamentable experience, and in the iudgement of euery mans conſcience. Thus farre man hath free-will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore regeneration, but the power thereof in theſe forenamed meanes, is not without the common helpe of Gods Spirit: for a man cannot ſay, that Ieſus is the Chriſt, but by the holy Ghoſt; and this will of man is alſo vnder Gods will, as all theſe places ſhew, Ier. 10. 23. Pro. 16. 1, 9. &amp; 19. 21. &amp; 20. 24. Iam. 4. 15. Pſal. 21. 11. Heb. 6. 3. Act. 18. 21. 1. Cor. 4. 9. For God in his wiſedome determineth all things, by his power ſubdueth all things, and by his prouidence diſpoſeth and guideth all things, Pſal. 135. 6. Epheſ. 1. 11.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, when God by his grace repaireth the loſſe of free-will in ſpirituall things, and giueth a man a will to repent, beleeue, loue, and obey God; then in theſe ſpirituall things hath his will
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1814:129"/> a power to beleeue, repent, and ſo forth, willing his owne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall comfort with God, and true fellowſhip with thoſe that truely loue God, but not before GOD worke this will in him; which will is yet but partly to good; for that it is partly to euill, being here ſanctified but in part, as appeareth by the infirmities, and falls of the godly; yea and this will wrought, needeth continuall aſſiſtance of diuine grace, that the ſame may will vnto the end. Theſe things premiſed, will helpe to anſwer the obiected Scriptures by the Aduerſarie, and to make eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the point in Controuerſie, and the queſtion betweene vs and them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſtate of their Tenet:</hi> That mans will hath a naturall power in it ſelfe, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working with Gods grace, in the very firſt inſtant act of a ſinners conuerſion, to which actiuitie of the will, ſuch conuerſion is in part to be attributed:</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Confuted by their owne Bible.</head>
                  <p>BY their owne Bible a man is wholly diſ-inabled of his own naturall will, though neuer ſo well morally qualified, truely to will ſpiritual good things for his owne eternall ſaluation, and peace with God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it ſheweth him to bee conceiued in iniquities and ſins, Pſal. 50. 7. and to be a tranſgreſſor from the wombe, Eſa. 48. 8.<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 7.</note> and to be a ſeruant to ſinne, Rom. 6. 20. and ſo it ſtrips nature, making a man naked of all ſpirituall good, as of abilitie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and know the things that are of the Spirit, 1. Cor. 2. 14. to ſee the Kingdome of God, Ioh. 3. 3. to thinke any thing of himſelfe, as of himſelfe, 2. Cor. 3. 5. For no good dwelleth in him, Rom. 7. 17. How then can we will that which wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceiue, nor know, nor ſee, nor ſo much as once thinke of, being indeed alienated from the life of God, Epheſ. 4. 18?
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1814:130"/> Without Chriſt able to doe nothing, Ioh. 15. 5. but are become altogether vnprofitable, not one of vs doing good, no, not ſo much as one, Rom. 3. 12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it taketh him (hauing thus found him naked, and without the life of God) and layeth him dead in the graue of ſinne, being dead in ſinnes and offences, Epheſ. 2. 1, 5. Col. 2. 13. Now what power of will is there in a dead man?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hauing thus put him dead into the graue of ſinne, it couereth him ouer with corruptions: His vnderſtanding is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured with darkneſſe, Epheſ. 4. 18. his wiſedome is an enemie to God, Rom. 8. 7. an enemie in ſenſe, Col. 1. 21. blindneſſe is ouer his heart, Epheſ. 4. 18. yea, all the cogitations of his heart are bent to euill at all times, Gen. 6. 6. peruerſe it is, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, Ier. 27. 9. and, as <hi>Montanus</hi> tranſlateth, deceitfull aboue all; ſo as it is not, neither can bee ſubiect to the Law of God, Rom. 8. 7. whereby hee is wholly giuen ouer; yea, and giueth himſelfe to the operation of all vncleanneſſe with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Epheſ. 4. 19. being vnwiſe, incredulous, erring, ſeruing diuers deſires, and voluptuouſneſſes, liuing in malice and enuie, hatefull, and hating one another, Tit. 3. 3. walking according to the courſe of the world, and according to the prince and ſpirit of Darknes, doing the wil of the fleſh and of the thoughts, and ſo by nature the child of wrath, Epheſ. 2. 2, 3. If it be thus with man by nature, where is the power of his free-will? ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we conſider him to be in the deuils ſnare, and held captiue at his will, 2. Tim. 2. 26?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, thus hauing couered him ouer with his foule cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, their Bible maketh him in the very firſt inſtant act of his conuerſion, meerely paſſiue; And this it doth:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by remouing the cauſe of our new-birth from our ſelues; we are not borne of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, Ioh. 1. 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by denying man to haue any thing to giue vnto God firſt: We haue not firſt giuen vnto him, Rom. 11. 35. Wee haue nothing that wee haue not receiued, neither haue wee whereof to glory, as not receiued, 1. Cor. 4. 7. by denying him to bee able to doe any thing, Ioh. 15. 5. as to haue power to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1814:130"/> heare Chriſts Word, Ioh. 8. 43. to beleeue, to receiue the Spirit of truth, Ioh. 14. 17. to know God, Matth. 11. 27. to chuſe Chriſt, Ioh. 15. 16. to come to Chriſt, Ioh. 6. 44. to enter into the Kingdome of God, Ioh. 3. 5. to come whither he is gone, Ioh. 8. 21. And the reaſon is giuen, becauſe they are not of God, Ioh. 8. 47. becauſe it is not giuen them of God, Luk. 8. 10. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not his ſheepe, Ioh. 10. 46. becauſe their eyes are blinded, and their hearts indurate, Ioh. 12. 40. and they haue not eyes to ſee, nor eares to heare, Rom. 11. 8. nor hearts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, 2. Cor. 2. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by affirming that very powerfull meanes: yea, though men be wiſe and prudent, yet are not auaileable, where God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not heart to vnderſtand, eyes to ſee, and eares to heare, Deut. 29. 3, 4. Luk. 19. 42. Matth. 11. 25, 27.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by aſcribing to God all that wee are, all that wee haue, all that we doe, and all that we can doe; both for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, for the increaſe, and for the continuance. By which we may ſee, how that it is Gods preuenting grace, that brings vs to him, and his grace alſo that confirmeth, increaſeth, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs vnto the end.</p>
                  <p>This alſo their Bible teacheth, and ſheweth how merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God preuenteth vs in all things, that no man might glory in himſelfe, but hee that glorieth, ſhould glory in the Lord, Ier. 9. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God, before ſuch men haue any being, as haue free-will in ſpirituall things, chooſes and predeſtinates them in Chriſt to be holy and blameleſſe, Epheſ. 1. 4. and preordinates them to beleeue, and to haue eternall life, Act. 13. 48. So as the ground of their ſaluation, is farre before their will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hauing thus choſen them, he findeth them, when they neither ſeeke, nor aske after him, Rom. 10. 20. they are his worke, Epheſ. 2. 10. made anew: they haue a new birth; Iam. 1. 18. being borne of God, Ioh. 1. 13. and of the Spirit, Ioh. 3. 5, 8. by the immortall ſeed of the Word, 1. Pet. 1. 23. Hee takes away vnwillingneſſe, and the ſtony heart, and giues them a will, Phil. 2. 23. euen a heart of fleſh to doe his will, Ezek. 11. 19, 20. and puts alſo into them a new heart, and a new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1814:131"/> Ezek. 36. 26. ſo is the new man created in iuſtice, and in the holineſſe of the truth, Epheſ. 4. 24. Thus God in mercie preuents mans will.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Man being thus begotten, thus borne and made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, the Lord quickneth him, Rom. 8. 11. Epheſ. 2. 5. and giueth him ſpirituall life, Ioh. 5. 21. 1. Cor. 15. 45. For now hee liueth, yet not he, but Chriſt liueth in him, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Gal. 2. 20. ſtill preuenting mans will.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when God, of a dead man hath made him aliue, and raiſed him vp againe, Col. 2. 12. then he openeth his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to vnderſtand the Scriptures, Luk. 24. 45. openeth his eyes, Pſal. 118. 18. Eſai. 35. 5. and 42. 7. his eares, Eſa. 50. 5. Iob<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 18. Pſal. 51. 17.</note> 33. 16. his lips, Pſal. 50. 17. his heart to attend to the Word, Act. 16. 14. In whoſe heart God now ſo ſhineth, as when hee commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, 2. Cor. 4. 6. and ſetteth them free, Ioh. 3. 37. ſtill in mercy preuenting mans will.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, thus God maketh way for himſelfe, opening mans vnderſtanding, eyes, eares, lips, and heart: he draweth vs vnto him, Ioh. 6. 44. and giueth his lawes into our hearts, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth them in our minds, Heb. 10. 16. Hee giueth vs diuine graces, ſpirituall wiſedome, Epheſ. 1. 17. the knowledge of the myſteries of the Kingdome of heauen, Matth. 13. 11. Faith, Epheſ. 2. 8. Phil. 1. 29. Loue, 1. Ioh. 4. 20. Feare, Ier. 32. 40. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, 2. Tim. 2. 25. Act. 5. 31. and 11. 18. and the Spirit to know the things that are giuen vs of God, reuealing vnto vs that which no eye can ſee, no eare can heare, no heart conceiue of, 1. Cor. 2. 9, 10, 12. Doth not God then by his grace preuent our will?</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, after his thus furniſhing vs with heauenly indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Ezek. 16. 9, 13. hauing wrought in vs the will, that we may be imployed in his ſeruice, he worketh alſo in vs the deed, Phil. 2. 13. hee teacheth vs to pray, Rom. 8. 26. powring out the Spirit of grace and prayer, Zach. 12. 10. Hee maketh vs to walke in his precepts, and to keepe his iudgements, Ezek.<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 18. 2. Cor. 9. 9, 11.</note> 11. 20. and it is of him that men haue great ſubſtance, a Chron. 32. 29. 1. Chro. 29. 16. and of him it is, that they beſtow of it
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1814:131"/> liberally, verſe 14. yea, if any doe ſuffer for his name, this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the gift of God, Phil. 2. 29.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, that all our ſufficiencie may be knowne to bee of God, their Bible telleth vs in general, that of him are all things, Rom. 11. 36. that euery beſt gift, and euery perfect gift is from aboue, Iam. 1. 17. that he beginneth the worke, Phil. 1. 6. that it is he alſo that increaſeth, 1. Cor. 3. 7. Epheſ. 2. 21. Col. 2. 19. perfecteth, Phil. 1. 6. Pſal. 138. 8. ſtrengtheneth and confirmeth, Rom. 16. 25. 1. Cor. 1. 8. and keepeth vs, 1. Pet. 1. 5. ſo that none ſhall plucke vs out of his hand, Ioh. 10. 28. and putteth his feare into our hearts, that we ſhall not depart from him, Ier. 32. 40. concluding, that all our ſufficiencie is of God, 2. Cor. 3. 5. and that it is hee that hath wrought all our workes in vs, Eſai. 26. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to all theſe reaſons, I may adde theſe fiue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Gods promiſing of his heauenly gifts and graces, as ſhewing men to be without them, till they receiue them from him: ſuch are thoſe in Ezek. 11. 19. Ier. 32. 39, 40. &amp; 31. 33, 34. &amp; 24. 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the prayers made vnto God to conuert men, Ier.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 36.</note> 31. 18. to fit them in all goodneſſe to doe his will, Heb. 13. 21. to ſanctifie and preſerue them without blame, 1. Theſ. 5. 23. doe ſhew that the power is from God, and not in man.</p>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1814:133"/> marry his Virgin, or not to marry her, man hath free-will, that is, power and right.</p>
                  <p>Ioh. 1. 11, 12. <hi>Hee came in to his owne, but his owne receiued him not, but as many as receiued him, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In the former part is mans inabilitie to entertaine Chriſt: they receiued him not, they would not. We grant mans free will to euill, till God change it. Secondly, in the latter part it is ſaid, Many receiued him. But it is not ſaid, By the power of their owne will. Wee acknowledge that by Gods preuenting grace, men may receiue Chriſt: which here is to be vnderſtood: for they that receiued him, did it by faith, and are ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him: but the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Faith is the gift of God;</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8. and not in mans power. Thirdly, the very next verſe following in this Chapter, verſe 13. cuts the nerues of the power of free-will in our new-birth. For ſaith the text, <hi>We are borne of God, not of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deut. 30. 19. <hi>I haue ſet before thee life and death, bleſſing and curſing: therefore chooſe life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This and all other exhortations and commandements, as Ioſ. 24. 14, 15. Deut. 10. 12. and 11. 16, 18. Epheſ. 4. 22. Phil. 2. 12. and in many other places in <hi>Moſes,</hi> Pſalmes, Prophets, and in the New Teſtament, doe not conclude in man any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power of his owne will, to chuſe or refuſe; to obey, or not to obey, of his owne free will, as our Aduerſaries doe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; no more then they can conclude, the lame man in Act. 2. 2. ſo borne, to bee able to riſe and walke, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Riſe vp and walke,</hi> verſe 6.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe in none of the exhortations, dehortations, and commandements, there is any mention of the power by which man comes to be able to performe that which hee is exhorted vnto. Therefore the power is to bee gathered out of other Scriptures, which is the power of Gods grace, and not the power of mans freewill; as all the Scriptures before alledged doe fully proue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for that all thoſe places doe no more but ſhew what duties man oweth to God, but not what hee can doe of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1814:133"/> himſelfe. A Creditor demanding paiment of his Debter, and exhorting him to pay, doth not therefore imply neceſſarily, that he is able to pay; for he may (perhaps) for all that, be altogether vnable to pay, as wee may reade, Matth. 18. 25. So theſe places ſhew what we owe, and what God requireth, but not that therefore we are able to pay what hee commandeth; for all the Scriptures afore alledged deny it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all theſe commandements, and exhortations, are ſpoken to thoſe in the Church, which conſiſts of a mixed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, both of vnregenerate, which are either abiects, or elect of God, till they be called, as alſo of regenerate perſons. Now, to the firſt ſort, God thus ſpeakes, ſhewing them what they could haue done (for God commandeth nothing that hath beene, is, and ſhall bee euer impoſſible to man) and what yet they ought to doe vpon perill of damnation; but not what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they now can doe, or ſhall hereafter be euer able to doe of themſelues, being dead in ſinne, and void of grace, and God not bound to giue it them. To the ſecond ſort, the elect, not yet borne a new by the Spirit, God thus ſpeakes, to ſhew not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they could haue done once, what now they ought to doe, but alſo what by Gods preuenting grace they may bee able, and ſhall doe. For God vſeth ſuch meanes to conuert them vnto him, at that time (the day of their viſitation being come) inwardly by his Spirit, and worketh their will to that which hee outwardly by word commandeth, and exhorteth vnto, Act. 2. 38, 41. As <hi>Peters</hi> exhortation to the lame man, by which God conueighed ſtrength and power into the man, to make him able to walke, Act. 3. 6, 7. This appeareth liuely in Ezek. 37. 7, 10. To the third ſort, the already Regenerate, who haue, by Gods preuenting grace, free will, God thus ſpeaketh, as to them that can doe what he commandeth, and exhorteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. He vſeth threats, to keepe them in awe: dehortations, to keepe them from ſinne: admonitions, to make them take heed: exhortations, to ſet them forward: promiſes, to encourage them, that ſo, by his euer-aſſiſting grace accompanying them, they may be raiſed, when they are fallen; be increaſed, that they decay not; and kept on in continuance to the end, that they neuer
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1814:134"/> fall away. Thus may we ſee, that theſe commandements, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and exhortations are not in vaine, though mans own will be not lifted vp thereby, as Papiſts dreame.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets vnder the Law ſpeake legally to men, ſo as if they neuer had fallen, but had kept their perfection, not regarding their now inabilitie after the fall: and therefore from ſuch legall charges and commands, wee cannot conclude mans power to performe. As for Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall commandements, they are aſſiſted by Gods Spirit, to worke in the elect grace of obedience in Chriſt, in and through whom they are made able to doe all things, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh. What then are theſe commandements to proue the power of mans free-will? Euen nothing at all, whether they be taken legally, or Euangelically.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 13. 34. <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, &amp;c. how often would I haue gathered thy children, &amp;c. and yee would not!</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This place ſpeakes of free-will vnto euill, to wit, the wills refuſing of the meanes of Saluation, in killing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſtoning them that were ſent of God for their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And this miſerable free will we acknowledge, which Chriſt complaineth of.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Its not denied, that we haue a free will to come to heare: 2. But to heare as ſhe did, and to make ſo bleſſed choice to entertaine Chriſts Word into her heart, whileſt her ſiſter was entertaining Chriſt at the table, was of Gods ſpeciall diuine grace, working in her the will and the deed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This proueth not the queſtion of the power of will in the firſt act of commiſſion. Secondly, this ſpeaketh of free libertie and power, which a man hath of his owne goods to giue, or not to giue: which power wee acknowledge a man hath. Thirdly, this is of an ill act, with-holding part of that from the Church, which hee ſeemed wholly to beſtow vpon it, which was hypocriſie: And to ſuch euils we grant man to haue free-will.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nothing to the queſtion. He ſpeaketh of freedome<note place="margin">A briefe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Scriptures on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cited by the <hi>Gagger.</hi>
                     </note> which other Apoſtles vſed, verſe 4, 5. So 2. Cor. 9. 7. of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reliefe to the poore Saints, Numb. 30. 14. ſpeakes of the Husbands power ouer the wife in her cauſe of vowing. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the queſtion. Ioſh. 14. 13. is of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> giuing <hi>Caleb</hi> Hebron for Inheritance. If the <hi>Gagger</hi> had cited the words, as he onely quoted the places, his folly would haue expoſed him to laughter. 2. Sam. 24. 12. I offer thee three things, chooſe thee one of them. This is meant of iudgements. What is this to the power of inward conuerſion? 1. King. 3. 5. God willeth <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> to aske of him. What God puts into our hearts to doe, that can wee doe. And <hi>Salomon</hi> was one endued already with diuine grace. But we ſpeake in the queſtion of the firſt act of conuerſion, of which theſe places ſpeake not one word. Matth. 19. 17. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the commandements.</hi> This is but ſuppoſitiuely ſet downe, not affirming the power of the will. Againe, it is ſpoken legally to a proudly conceited young man, who iuſtified himſelfe, but vntruely, as the euent ſhewed in the verſes following. Ioſh. 24. 15. is anſwered before, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Deut. 30. 19. But yet alſo note farther, the former part of the verſe, is of euill propounded, as the ſeruing of other gods, which mans will is apt to. The latter part ſpeakes of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> who was already a holy Prince; and ſo is not to the queſtion. 2. Sam. 12. no verſe is quoted. Prou. 11. 24. ſpeakes of one that ſcattereth, and with-holdeth more then is meet. This is of morall actions; the one part of liberalitie, the other of niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; in which wee acknowledge free-will. Eſai. 1. 19, 20. If thou bee willing and obedient, &amp;c. but if ye refuſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1814:135"/> &amp;c. The latter words are ſpoken of that which mans will is free enough to doe: the former ſpeakes of being willing by a ſuppoſition, as God ſpake to <hi>Cain, If thou doeſt well,</hi> which<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> yet was farre from him. And we acknowledge free-will to good things, when God makes man willing.</p>
                  <p>Reuel. 3. 20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the doore and knocke, if any man heare my voice, and open the doore, I will come in to him, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe words are Metaphorically ſpoken, and ſo not to be taken after the letter, and therefore cannot be a ſound proofe in a controuerted point. Secondly, mans act is ſet downe but onely ſuppoſitiuely, and ſo affirmeth nothing of him ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Thirdly, it is ſaid that man heareth and openeth: yet the queſtion is, By what power, whether by his owne, or by Gods preuenting grace? which here is not expreſſed, but in other places it is: For it is aſcribed to the Lord that openeth the eare, Eſai. 50. 5. Iob 33. 16. Hee openeth the heart, Act. 16. 14. yea, He it is that openeth the doore of faith, Act. 14. 37. the doore of vtterance, Col. 4. 3. and the doore of the paſſage of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, 2. Cor. 2. 12. 1. Cor. 16. 9. Fourthly, Chriſts knocking firſt by the Word, is the meanes hee vſeth to conuey the grace of his Spirit into our hearts, to make vs to open to him. So by <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſterie, he knocked at the doore of <hi>Lydia's</hi> heart, and he by his Spirit then opened the ſame, as the text ſheweth very plainely. Act. 16. 14. So Chriſt by his owne preaching knocked, and in knocking opened the doore of vnderſtanding to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Luk. 24. 45.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point of free-will herein, that men bee not deceiued by the Aduerſaries, deceitfull Allegations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, let them diligently obſerue the queſtion, which is of the power of free-will in matters ſpirituall, in the firſt act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, which is by Gods Word wholly aſcribed vnto God himſelfe. Neither can our Aduerſaries bring any Scripture to proue, that it is in the power of mans will to prepare it ſelfe thereto. For all the places they alledge, are <hi>either</hi> to prooue freedome of will in nature, humane, morall, ſinfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in outward actions tending to pietie: Or the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vrged are ſuch as ſpeake of mans free-will in ſpirituall
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1814:135"/> actions, and theſe may bee reduced to three heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to thoſe which perſwade, exhort, and command men to turne and repent, to doe good workes, to beleeue, loue and obey God. To which a full anſwer is made before to Deut. 30. 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to thoſe which ſpeake of men holpen by God in workes of pietie, which are to be vnderſtood of ſuch as be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by Gods aſſiſting grace, who haue been prepared before by his preuenting grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to thoſe, where men are ſaid to be co-workers with God, which muſt be vnderſtood of them, in whom God hath wrought both the will and deed firſt: for ſo they worke, and God alſo in them. Phil. 2. 12, 13. Through Chriſt, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, I can doe all things, who ſtrengtheneth mee. Phil. 4. 13. I liue, ſaith he, and Chriſt in me. So they liue together, Gal. 2. 20. I labour, ſaith he, yet not I, but the grace of God, which was with me, 2. Cor. 15. 10. He labours, and grace aſſiſteth him.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe places wee may anſwer generally thus: Firſt, that wee doe acknowledge a freedome of will in ſpirituall things, when God hath firſt wrought it in vs. Secondly, that thoſe places alledged of them, ſpeake of Gods commanding, yea, and commending of holy mens willingneſſe, prayers, and holy words, good workes; but they doe not manifeſt by what power they ſo will, ſo pray, profeſſe, and practiſe, and therefore doe not determine the queſtion in hand. Which other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cleerely doe for vs, and againſt our Aduerſaries.</p>

               <p>Firſt, all thoſe ſinnes and negligences, into which through weakeneſſe, vpon euery little occaſion, men euery houre do fall.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:1814:136"/>
               <p>Secondly, all the ill motions of the heart, being without full deliberation and conſent; as the ſudden paſſions of the minde, concupiſcence, anger, deſire of reuenge, and ſuch like, ſo, vaine and idle thoughts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuch words, as ſudden and violent paſſion, without precedent deliberation and intent, forceth: as in a rage and fury to ſweare and curſe. So cholericke anſwers for trifles, rayling and reproachfull termes. To theſe adde exceſſiue prating, idle talking, ſcurrilous and filthy ſpeaking, ribald ſongs, officious lying, without damage to a mans neighbour, vaine boaſting, preferring his owne wit, ſtrength and beauty before others.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſuch ſinnes as a man committeth againſt his owne good; as to ſpend his time idly, gouerne his eſtate badly, waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſuming his goods, louing to play at Cards, and Dice, and to goe to Playes; to exceede in apparell, eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, with delight of his belly.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſinnes towards others; as children diſobeying Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, when it is of negligence and ſenſualitie. To ſteale trifles, and things of little value.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, ſuch ſinnes as bee outward to-moue delight, as pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the face: or for paſtime; as ſcoffing and obſcene ieſts and geſtures in Playes, and ſuch like in ſport.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, ſuch ſinnes as are againſt pietie and deuotion; as not to ſanctifie well the Sabbath day; to faſt, pray, giue almes, and to goe to the Church for vaine-glory, to confeſſe ſinnes negligently, and many other beſides: all theſe they count ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Heere may we ſee plainely how it comes to paſſe, that vaine people loue ſo much that vaine licentious Religion, runne to it, and continue in it: and the reaſons are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, for that they make ſuch euils as theſe, and many other moe, yea, ſome kinde of ſoule ſecret euils, veniall, or no ſinnes at all; not ſimply ſinnes, but imperfectly and onely ſinnes in ſome ſort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe they hold and teach, that theſe are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to God, are pardonable without repentance, not deſerue hell, not in ſtrictneſſe of neceſſitie to bee confeſſed to a Prieſt,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1814:136"/> neither can God in iuſtice puniſh them, more then with a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe that as they teach, God doth eaſily pardon and forgiue theſe, and the remedies preſcribed, are for the moſt part very eaſie, which be theſe; the giuing of Almes, knocking vpon our breſt with ſome remorſe, going into a Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing holy water with a deuout motion, the Biſhops bleſſing, croſſing of ones ſelfe, bearing with other folkes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and froward dealings towards vs, confeſſing our ſinnes in generall, hearing of Maſſe deuoutly, and to be patient in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and troubles.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are taught, ſome by one ſort, ſome by another ſort of their learned men: See <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aux</hi> his Engliſh Catechiſme: alſo the <hi>mirrour to confeſſe well,</hi> and D. <hi>Whites Way, digreſſ.</hi> 38. Doctor <hi>White,</hi> his <hi>Orthodox way, cap. 1. obſ. 2. ſect. 3. pag. 28. in quarto,</hi> who doe produce the Authors which teach theſe.</p>
               <p>To hold that there are any ſuch ſinnes as theſe, or any ſinnes at all, veniall in their owne nature, and not deſeruing damnation, is the very nurſery of fleſhly libertie, and the high-way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Confuted by their owne Bible.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, it telleth vs, that death is the ſtipend of ſinne, (not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting any) Rom. 6. 21, 23. and pronounceth that the ſoule that ſhall ſinne, the ſame ſhall dye, Ezek. 18. 20. and that hee is curſed that abideth not in the words of this Law, and fulfilleth them not, Deut. 27. 26. Gal. 3. 10. making him that offendeth in one, to be guiltie of all, Iam. 2. 10. and by it alſo wee learne that deaths ſting is ſinne, 1. Cor. 15. 56. And therefore, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is ſinne, that ſame is mortall. If it bee ſinne, it is the ſting of death: and, if deaths ſting, then is it mortall. For death doth euer ſting deadly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it threatneth death and hell for ſuch ſinnes as they count veniall; offences ſeeming very little: as in anger to call one foole, is in danger of hell fire, Matth. 5. 23. and for filthineſſe, fooliſh talke, or ſcurrilitie, commeth the anger of God,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1814:137"/> Epheſ. 5. 4. 6. yea we are told, that for euery idle word men ſhall ſpeake, they ſhall render an account in the Day of Iudgement, and that, as guilty of death, Matth. 12. 36. And though our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries doe hold it a veniall ſinne, for a man not to husband well his owne eſtate, liuing careleſſely and idle; yet Chriſt held it a ſinne worthy damnation, Matth. 25. 26, 27, 30. To bee a bragger, to be deceitfull, to breake a mans couenant, to bee without knowledge, though they ranke not theſe among hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crimes, yet deſerue they death, as we learne by their Bible, Rom. 1. 32.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it telleth vs, that, for ſeeming ſmall offences, many haue beene fearefully puniſhed; as <hi>Lots</hi> wife, for looking backe, to haue beene turned into a Statue of Salt, Gen. 19. 26. For gathering ſticks on the Sabbath day, God commanded to ſtone a man to death, Numb. 15. 35. and one for blaſpheming vpon paſſion, when he was ſtriuing with another, Leuit. 24. 10, 14. Some of <hi>Aarons</hi> ſonnes, for offering ſtrange fire, were burnt to death with fire from heauen, Leuit. 10. 1, 5. <hi>Vzzah,</hi> of a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but touching the Arke, was ſtriken dead of God, 2. Sam. 6. 7. The Bethſhemites, for but looking into the Arke, were ſmitten dead, to the number of aboue fifty thouſand, 1. Sam. 6. 19. The Iſraelites ſlaine in the Wilderneſſe, 1. Cor. 10. For vnaduiſedly ſpeaking; yea, when it came from a vexed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated ſpirit, was <hi>Moſes</hi> puniſhed, Pſal. 105. 32, 33. he was not permitted to goe into Canaan, which was a type of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but hee muſt dye before, euen <hi>Moſes.</hi> Now, whatſoeuer ſinne vnder the Law God puniſhed with death, or commanded to be puniſhed by death; the ſame, without remiſſion, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued eternall death. For the firſt time that death is mentioned, it is to bee vnderſtood of death temporall and eternall, due to all, had not there beene a Mediatour betweene God and vs, Gen. 2. 17.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it teacheth, that Originall ſinne (which is leſſe then any actuall ſinne, whether in thought, word, or deed) is puniſhed with death, Rom. 5. 12. Now, if the reward of this ſinne be death, then ſurely much more any other flowing from thence, (though it ſeeme to man neuer ſo ſmall an offence) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1814:137"/> death, as the very conſent of the minde to other euill doers, among which <hi>boaſters</hi> are reckoned, is worthy of death, Rom. 1. 32. yea, and <hi>Commeſſations,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Reuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> wherein too many much delight, is a ſinne, which keepes the doers thereof that they cannot obtaine the Kingdome of God, Gal. 5. 21.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, ſinnes of ignorance vnder the law, Leuit. 4. 2, 13, 27. had ſacrifices appointed to make an atonement to God for them. Now, all ſacrifices for ſinne, ſhewed that a man deſerued death for euery ſuch ſinne. Now, if ſinnes of ignorance deſerue death, what may all men think of ſuch ſins, as Papiſts call veniall, before-mentioned, plainely forbidden by the Word of God?</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, to commit adulterie, is a mortall ſinne: but their Bible telleth vs, that for one to ſee a woman to luſt after her, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>already committed adulterie with her in his heart, Matth. 5. 28. And can any ſinne ſeeme leſſe then concupiſcence of the heart, ſuddenly ariſing by the obiect to the ſight? And yet Papiſts make wanton dalliances no ſinne, or as none in their account.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, it ſheweth, that it is Chriſts bloud, that cleanſeth from all ſinne, 1. Ioh. 1. Now, if euery ſinne needs cleanſing by his bloud, then euery ſinne in its owne nature is mortall, in that it cannot be cleanſed, but by his death.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This place proueth not any ſinnes to be veniall, and not mortall in their owne nature. For firſt, this ſhould be againſt the ſcope of Chriſts ſpeech, in confuting the Phariſes miſ-vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Law, and here in particular, the ſixt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. They ſtucke to the Letter; Chriſt here extendeth the breach of this Law, to thoughts, and words; ſo making a man by cauſeleſſe anger, and railing words, to be before God guiltie of murder. Is this then to make ſinne veniall? or are not rather thoſe, which they conceit to bee veniall, by Chriſt here made mortall, if to be guilty of bloud before God, be mortall? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, here is no difference made of ſinnes in their nature; but onely here is ſhewed the degrees of ſinning, and that one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is greater then another. For faine would I know of them, how they can diſtinguiſh theſe in nature, that anger and calling one Racha, ſhould be veniall; and to call one Foole, to bee mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall? Thirdly, the puniſhments here expreſſed, diſtinguiſh not the nature of the ſinnes, but ſhew the degrees of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according as men ſinne. For as God in mercy will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mens well-doings with degrees of glory; ſo in iuſtice will he in hell, the damned with degrees of puniſhment, Matth. 10. 15. Fourthly, whereas our Aduerſaries make Iudgement, and Councill, temporall puniſhments for veniall ſinnes, and hell fire for mortall ſinnes, taking aduantage by the tranſlation of the word <hi>Gehenna:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is cleere, that puniſhments doe not alter the nature of ſinnes; but being duely executed, doe ſhew onely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſinne, to be greater, or leſſer, and ſo are they according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed. Secondly, Papiſts themſelues hold vnaduiſed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and words euen tending to blaſphemie, comming of ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and vnaduiſed anger, as the word Racha, and Foole doe here, to be veniall ſinnes. Therefore they erre in diſtinguiſhing the ſinnes thus into veniall; and mortall, which they themſelues account to be veniall. Thirdly, the puniſhments here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are ſuch as either concerne the ciuill Magiſtrate, to inflict temporally here; or ſuch meant, as God will inflict eternally in another world; but theſe are not puniſhable by the Magiſtrate in theſe caſes: for we finde not in Scripture any Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:1814:139"/> for Magiſtrates to call men into iudgement for vnaduiſed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; or to a Councill, or to burne men for calling one Racha, or Foole, proceeding no further. Therefore the puniſhments are meant, ſuch as God will inflict eternally in the life to come. If ſo, then I anſwer: Fourthly, that Iudgement, Councill, and hell fire, are the degrees of Gods puniſhment vpon the wicked in hell. Fifthly and laſtly, whereas by the tranſlation, hell fire is giuen to the third, and not to the other two, they would by the other vnderſtand onely temporall puniſhments, and by this, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall; they are greatly deceiued, or would deceiue, or do both. Firſt, for that theſe kinds of ſinnes here expreſſed, will not admit this diſtinction, there being no ſuch great difference betweene the ſinnes, as that the former ſhould deſerue but onely tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhments in this world, or (as they dreame) in Purgatory, and the other eternall in hell. Secondly, becauſe the words in all the puniſhments, are firſt to be conceiued and taken, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proceeding after the accuſtomed forme of ciuill iudgements among the Iewes: for ſome puniſhment was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, according to the ſentence of the loweſt Court, here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by iudgement, like to our petty Seſſions; Some, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſentence of a higher Court, their Sanhedrin conſiſting of three and twenty Elders, like to our Quarter Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and ſome, according to the ſentence of the higheſt Court, the great Councill at Ieruſalem conſiſting of ſeuentie Elders, like to our great Aſſizes, whoſe ſentence was inflicted vpon the preſumptuous and greateſt offendors, Deut. 17. 12. worthy of the place named <hi>Gehenna,</hi> which was alſo called <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth,</hi> in the valley of the children of Hinnom, in the Suburbs of Ieruſalem, where Idolaters made their children to paſſe thorow the fire, to the Idol Molech, 2. King. 23. 10. 2. Chron. 28. 3. Ier. 7. 31, 32. which places <hi>Ioſias</hi> defiled with filth, in deteſtation thereof, and became to be for ſuch execrable Idolatry, moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, and ſo deteſtable, as that for ſuch as were worthy the greateſt torments, <hi>Topheth</hi> was ſaid to bee prepared, Eſai. 30. 33. Whereupon it came to be at length taken for Hell fire, the place of the damned, as here, in Matth. 5. 29, 30. and 10. 28. and 18. 9. and 23. 25, 33. Iam. 3. 6. but here firſt taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1814:139"/> as the other two are before, and then applyed vnto Gods inflicting puniſhment: as if it had been ſaid, As you Iewes here in your countrey doe make difference of offences, and ſo haue differing degrees of puniſhing with death, according to your ſeuerall Courts: So after this life, God accordingly in Hell hath degrees of puniſhment, for differing ſinnes, which here men doe commit. Thus ſtandeth the ſimilitude: Elſe it were abſurd, as Papiſts make it to be, partly of temporall, and partly of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall puniſhment: for as there bee three degrees of ſinne; bad, worſe, and worſt of all; and three degrees of puniſhment with death, by hanging, ſtoning, and burning, firſt, by iudgement, which is great: then by Councill, which is greater; and laſtly, by higheſt Court, as with <hi>Gehenna,</hi> the greateſt of all: ſo is it with God in puniſhing the wicked, with ſeuerall degrees of puniſhments after death.</p>

But they proue not, that therefore ſome onely deſerue eternall death; and the other only temporall and not eternall.

Secondly, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie, and falſhood of ſuch an expoſition, is before confuted out of Matth. 5. 25, 26. where it is alledged for Purgatorie, in which place onely veniall ſinnes are payed for, compared to farthings, and mites. But what is this laſt mite a mite of? Is it of a ſumme which conſiſts all of mites? or elſe of other moneys, and of greater ſummes? To affirme it a ſumme of all mites, were but an idle dreame: and, if it conſiſts of greater ſummes,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1814:140"/> then is the party caſt into priſon for theſe alſo. Then the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie vrged to maintaine Purgatorie, makes it a place to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie both for mortall and veniall ſinnes, which our Aduerſaries deny.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It hath beene alledged before for Purgatorie, and there anſwered at full. But here yet further I anſwer: Secondly, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here of vnwholſome, and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrines. And are theſe veniall ſinnes? Is errour in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, not a ſinne in its owne nature? Is it not worthy of death, to miſ-lead by impure preaching, and to breed errours in mens minds? He is curſed with <hi>Amen,</hi> that makes the blind goe out<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 18.</note> of their way.</p>
                  <p>Iam. 7. 14. <hi>Euery one is tempted of his owne concupiſcence, drawne, and enticed: then when luſt hath conceiued, it bringeth forth ſinne; and ſinne when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death.</hi> Where they make ſome motions, no ſinnes; ſome ſinnes, but not dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and other-ſome, deadly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is no diſtinction of ſinnes in their natures; but a genealogie of ſinne, from the mother concupiſcence, and the deſerued reward thereof in the end, which is death. Here is no veniall ſinne. For firſt, death is due to the mother, <hi>lust;</hi> which luſt is ſinne, Rom. 7. and worthy of death, Rom. 5. Secondly, he ſpeakes here of ſinne ſingularly, the fruit of luſt, conceiued, brought forth, and ripened; as of one and the ſame ſinne grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the full height, and not of diuers kinds of ſinnes, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in nature. Thirdly, when <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, that luſt brings forth ſinne, it is not by calling the fruit thereof ſinne, to cleere luſt from being ſinne: for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it ſinne, Rom. 7. and what is it that naturally brings forth ſinne, that in it ſelfe is not ſinne? but it is to diſtinguiſh naturall corruption, from actuall tranſgreſſion. Fourthly, death is put in the laſt place for ſinne conſummate, and not that luſt is not worthy of death, nor the ſinne which floweth thence; but to ſhew whereto our owne corrupt nature drawne and entiſed, will at length bring vs by ſinning euen vnto death, if it bee not mortified. And therefore
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1814:140"/> this text is nothing for the proofe of their vntrue diſtinction of veniall, and mortall ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Prou. 24. 16. <hi>A iuſt man falleth ſeuentimes, and riſeth vp againe. Ergo,</hi> Men may commit ſinnes veniall, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine iuſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is no proofe, that theſe falls or ſinnes are not mortall in themſelues. For that a iuſt man ſinning, remaineth iuſt, is not from the nature of the ſinnes, which he doth fall into: but from the ſtate of adoption, and Gods mercy which giueth him grace to repent (which is here to bee vnderſtood by his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againe) God accepting of him in Chriſt, through whom he is accounted iuſt, and in whom all his ſinnes are veniall.</p>

               <p>THe queſtion is not of man before his fall: for he could then<note place="margin">The ſtate of the queſtion.</note> keepe them: nor of man in corrupt eſtate: for hee cannot keepe them, being altogether wicked, and euill, as before is proued: nor of man in ſtate of glory, being in all perfection, and able perfectly to doe the will of God.</p>
               <p>But the queſtion is of man, regenerate in the ſtate of grace, as he here liueth, going on, by Gods aſſiſting grace, vnto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in glory. Neither is the queſtion here of any kinde of keeping: for the regenerate man, in diuers reſpects, may bee ſaid to keepe Gods commandements. Firſt, <hi>Imputatiuely,</hi> in<note place="margin">Retract. lib. 2. cap. 19.</note> Chriſt, who is our Wiſedome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification, and Redemption, and through whom we are pardoned.

Thirdly, in <hi>reſpect of his endeuour,</hi> and carefull ſtriuing in all good conſcience, to frame his life after theſe commandements: ſo keeping them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                     <hi>Anſw. 1. All things</hi> muſt of neceſſitie be limited: for <hi>Paul</hi> could not doe all things without exception. Secondly, they are to bee applyed to the <hi>all things,</hi> which hee before ſpake of in the former verſe: that is, to bee abaſed, and to abound. <hi>In all things,</hi> ſaith he, I am inſtructed, both to be full, and to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; both to abound, and to ſuffer need. Here, we ſee, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle limits his <hi>all things,</hi> to theſe kinde of things. Thirdly, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in cannot bee included the commandements, for that the Apoſtle ſhould here contradict himſelfe: For in Rom. 7. 18, 19, 20. ſpeaking of the Law, he profeſſeth his inabilitie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which is good. Fourthly, let it be granted, that here the commandements are included, as they would; yet, perfect obedience will not bee hence included. For its one thing to be a doer, and another thing to doe all in perfection. A man may ſay hee is to doe, and can doe all his Maſters buſineſſe. Will it therfore follow, that he ſo doth it, as no defect euer at any time, or in any thing, is to be found in him? Fiftly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of his abilitie of doing all things, through Chriſt ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him thereto. But where is it written, that Chriſt ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth any man, perfectly to fulfill the whole Law? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> found not this in him, as before is noted out of Rom. 7. Nor Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> when hee forſwore his Maſter; and when hee after diſſembled, and was openly, and worthily rebuked by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.

                  <p>Luk. 1. 5, 6. <hi>And they were both righteous before God, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That they were righteous, we acknowledge it, and alſo before God, by the Text it is cleere, and ſo are all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate at this day. But how, by workes? Not ſo before God. The Apoſtle teacheth the contrary, Rom. 4. 2. and the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 143. 2. But by faith in Chriſt, Rom. 4. 3, 9. Phil. 3. 9. who was made ſinne for vs, that wee might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him, 2. Cor. 5. 21. By which righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, we are righteous before God: and yet for all this, not without ſinne in our ſelues. For was not <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles righteous? yet both acknowledge themſelues to haue ſinne, 1. Ioh. 1. 8, 10. Iam. 3. 2. Secondly, <hi>Walking in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> is here added, as the fruit of their righteouſneſſe, the manifeſt ſigne thereof, and declaration of thankefulneſſe, as in Gen. 17. and not as the cauſe of it. For by the workes of the Law ſhall none be iuſtified before God, Rom. 3. 20. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a man may walke faintly, he may halt; yea, now and then ſlip, and yet be in the right way. Fourthly, by ſaying <hi>in all,</hi> it noteth not perfection in obedience, as may appeare in <hi>Dauid,</hi> though of him it be ſaid, Act. 13. 22. that he ſhould performe all Gods will; yet hee fell fearefully ſometime; but it ſet out their ſoundneſſe of heart, hauing reſpect to all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ordinances of God, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh, Pſal. 119. 6, 117. for they did not ſeuer the commandements in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but made conſcience of one, as well, as of another. Fifthly, whereas it is ſaid, <hi>without blame,</hi> or <hi>blameleſſe.</hi> This is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſo before men; but not before God. For firſt, God ſtrucke him dumbe, for his vnbeliefe, verſe 20. Secondly, his very office, as hee was a Prieſt, conuinceth him of ſinne: for the Prieſt ſacrificed as well for himſelfe, as for the people, Heb. 5. 3. So that he was not blameleſſe before God.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 11. 27. <hi>Bleſſed are they, that heare the Word of God, and keepe it.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This place proueth not the point in queſtion: for wee acknowledge, that the regenerate doe keepe Gods Word. But how? Not fully and perfectly, which is the queſtion, and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1814:143"/> is not hence proued. Secondly, imperfect obedience through Chriſt is accepted, and ſuch a one may be bleſſed. Thirdly, who knoweth not what imperfections are in hearing? And the ſame is much more in keeping. Fourthly, hearing and keeping, are a declaration of ſuch as bee bleſſed; and not the cauſe of their bleſſedneſſe. The like anſwer may be made to Ioh. 13. 17. &amp; 14. 23. Matth. 12. 50.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 11. 2. <hi>Thy will be done, as in Heauen, ſo in Earth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This proueth not what men here on earth doe; but what they ſhould pray for, and begge of God to doe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee are not here taught to begge any thing impoſſible nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the word <hi>as,</hi> hath not relation to the degree of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection of obedience in heauen; but to the manner of doing Gods will there, <hi>willingly, ioyfully, faithfully,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,</hi> which we deſire to imitate here, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace, which we receiued of God. The <hi>Gagger</hi> calleth this Petition a demand; as if in Prayer wee were not beggers, but claimers of our dues, and rights, from God: ſee the proud ſpirit of an Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>1. Ioh. 5. 3. <hi>This is the loue of God, that we keepe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; and his commandements are not grieuous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Wee acknowledge, that the loue of God neither is, nor can bee without obedience to the commandements, for true loue forceth thereto: obedience is the true fruit of loue, and the true ſigne thereof. So as theſe words, This is the loue of God, may be thus expounded; This is the true ſigne of the loue of God, that wee keepe his commandements. Secondly, this doth not proue the point: for wee acknowledge alſo the keeping of Gods commandements; but wee deny the perfect keeping fully, according to the rigour and ſtrictneſſe of the Law, which this place ſpeakes not of. Thirdly, touching the praiſe of them, as not grieuous, or heauy. This is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not ſo, in reſpect of the commandements themſelues, for they are a heauy yoake, according to theſe places, Act. 15. 10. Rom. 8. 3. and 7. 14. but in reſpect of ſuch as be in Chriſt, to whom the commandements are not heauy nor grieuous. Firſt, for that Chriſt helpeth them with his grace and holy Spirit to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1814:143"/> keepe them. Secondly, becauſe they truely loue God, and ſo are willing to vndergoe any thing for Chriſt; and ſo to a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde, nothing is grieuous. Thirdly, for that they haue a ſpirituall delight in Gods commandements, feeling the peace of a good conſcience, in well doing. Fourthly, for that ſuch men doe not in their minde eſteeme them heauy, or grieuous. Laſtly, they may be ſaid, not to bee heauy and grieuous, reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely to that which they were before Chriſt, through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt incumbrances vnder <hi>Moſes:</hi> but now Chriſt hath fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them for vs, he hath borne the burthen, remoued the curſe, made vs by faith fulfillers of them; and thus are they not heauy, nor grieuous: but yet it proueth not, that any man can keepe the commandements.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gagger</hi> hath collected many other places, onely he citeth them, but vrgeth them not. Ezek. 36. 27. <hi>Walke in my Statutes, and keepe my iudgements, and doe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is no mention of either the manner, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which was the thing he ſhould haue proued: elſe we grant all. The like anſwer is to Eccluſ. 15. 15. which booke is not Canonical.</p>
                  <p>Matth. 11. 30. <hi>My yoake is eaſie, and burthen is light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no mention of commandements. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Chriſts yoake is not the Law; but the doctrine of the Goſpell, and his owne diſcipline. Thirdly, whatſoeuer is meant by yoake and burthen, the ſame being Chriſts to the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, it is eaſie, and light, by the former reaſons alledged to the place of 1. Ioh. 5. 3.</p>
                  <p>Matth. 19. 17. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This place impoſeth a duty, but proueth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance: for it is one thing for God to command, and another thing for man to perform his commandement. Secondly, Chriſt ſpeakes not here thus to this yong man, as imploying abilitie in him to keepe the commandements, but to anſwer to the pride of his heart, to conuict him thereof, and to diſcouer to him his hypocriſie: for when he commanded him but one thing, verſe 21, 22. he failed in performance.</p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:1814:144"/>
                  <p>Rom. 13. 8. <hi>He that loueth another, hath fulfilled the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> As our loue is, ſo is the Law fulfilled; but our loue is imperfect: for wee are exhorted to increaſe in it, 1. Theſ. 4. 10. therefore is our obedience imperfect. Secondly, the Apoſtle telleth vs in verſe 10. how loue is the fulfilling of the Law, for that it worketh no ill to our neighbour. Where note firſt, that here he ſpeakes of loue to our neighbour, and not of the loue to God. And ſecondly, that loues fulfilling of the Law, is in the negatiue, in not working ill; and not in the affirmatiue, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well; and therefore but a poore perfection of obedience. Thirdly, it is the fulfilling of the Law, becauſe the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſecond Table, are comprehended in the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of louing our neighbour as our ſelues, verſe 9. and not for that loue makes vs ſufficient, perfectly to fulfill the whole Law.</p>
                  <p>Rom. 7. 3. Is nothing at all to the purpoſe. It ſpeakes of the wife freed or not freed from the Law of her husband.</p>
                  <p>Ioſh. 11. 15. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The praiſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſua</hi> in their obedience. But firſt, this was in their ſeruices performed in ſuch outward things as God commanded them, and not of their ſpirituall obedience to the Morall Law. Secondly, if applyed to proue perfection in them, it is miſ-applyed: for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> offended God, ſo as hee dyed, before the people came into Canaan; yea, he ſo diſpleaſed the Lord, as God would not heare him in his requeſt, to let him goe into the Land.</p>
                  <p>Alſo <hi>Ioſua</hi> erred againſt the commandement of God, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnaduiſedly a league with the Gibeonites.

Now, if the iuſt man ſinne, then he needeth repentance. And the Lords Prayer teacheth to aske dayly forgiueneſſe. Secondly, the words were ſpoken againſt the proud conceited Scribes and Phariſes, verſe 2. who thought themſelues ſuch iuſt ones: but we not. Thirdly, the words may be ſpoken comparatiuely, in reſpect of ſuch as notoriouſly breaking out, as the ſtray ſheepe, the other keeping within bounds, may be ſaid to be iuſt, and to need no repentance, like the other out-ſtrayer.</p>

Thus we ſee, that there is no perfection of obedience in any to keepe the Law. Therefore is there no workes of ſupererrogation: for they that boaſt of theſe, muſt bee in all perfection obedient to the Law firſt, and then doe more then God commandeth, either expreſly or deriuatiuely.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt here teacheth not, that a man may in this life attaine to perfection, to doe all that God commands; and more too: For firſt, he had taught the contrary, Luk. 17. 10. Secondly, in Mark. 10. 21. Chriſt leaueth out the word per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and telleth him plainly that he lacked one thing. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> for all his excellencies, and his manifold ſufferings for Chriſt, 2. Cor. 6. 4, 10. yet hee did not attaine to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Phil. 3. 12. But here Chriſt ſpeaketh to the vainely concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yong man; who as <hi>Auſtin. in Epiſt.</hi> 89. ſaith, anſwered more arrogantly then truely: and as <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, gaue falſe teſtimonie of himſelfe, when he ſaid, he had kept all theſe, to wit, all the<note place="margin">Ad Hilarium, lib. 4. de linquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis facultatibus.</note> commandements, from his youth vp, ſaying, What lack I yet? as if he had lacked nothing, when he was apparantly couetous,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1814:146"/> Mar. 10. 22. To ſuppreſſe this exceſſe of pride, and to diſcouer his folly, Chriſt thus ſpeakes to him, and not to ſet out a new Doctrine, and way to perfection, not contained in the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, theſe words are not a bare counſell, as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>if thou wilt.</hi> For this kinde of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, notes not the thing ſpoken of, to bee euer in a mans li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and pleaſure to doe, or not to doe; for ſo then ſhould we not be tyed to Gods commandements: for thus hee ſpeakes in vrging to the obedience of them, in verſe 17. of this Chapter, and Deut. 28. 1, 15. it is ſaid, <hi>If thou wilt,</hi> or, <hi>if thou wilt not.</hi> So in Eſa. 1. 19. Theſe words imply not the libertie of choiſe, but rather the deſire of the minde, to attaine to ſome thing yet lacking, as by comparing <hi>Matthew</hi> here with <hi>Mark.</hi> chap. 10. 21. it may appeare.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the words, <hi>giue vnto the poore,</hi> are plainely a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. This is a duty commanded, and the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the works of Charitie, and Almes to be giuen to the poore. This is no counſell left to mans free choiſe to doe, or not to doe, as theſe places ſhew, 1. Tim. 6. 17, 18, 19. Heb. 13. 16. <hi>to ſtriue to perfection</hi> is commanded alſo, Matth. 5. 48. Heb. 6. 1. 2. Cor. 7. 1. increaſing more and more, 1. Theſ. 1. 10. and 4. 1, 10. 1. Pet. 2. 2. 2. Pet. 3. 18. Act. 20. 32. So it is not in our libertie to ſtand at a ſtay, but we are tyed, and bound to grow in grace, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in faith, and in good workes. Thirdly, <hi>Goe and ſell all that thou haſt.</hi> This alſo is a commandement, for it hath the forme of a commandement, <hi>Goe and ſell.</hi> And though it be not an ordinary commandement to binde all: yet was it a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to this young man for the preſent, to try him, and to diſcouer him; as Gods commandement to <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his ſonne, Gen. 22. Seeing therefore that theſe words containe in them Commandements, and not a bare counſell, this place is nothing for arrogantly conceited works of ſupererrogation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if it were granted to bee a counſell; yet being Gods counſell, it is not beſt to our libertie, to doe or not to doe: for God (who is great and wonderfull in counſell, Eſai. 28. 29. Ierem. 32. 19.) his counſell bindeth, and to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and deſpiſe it, is ſinne, and deſerues puniſhment, Pſal.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1814:146"/> 106. 13. and 107. 11. Prou. 1. 25. Luk. 7. 30. And therefore vpon Gods counſels, they can build no workes of ſupererro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                  <p>1. Cor. 7. 25. <hi>Now concerning Virgins, I haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the Lord: yet I giue my iudgement, &amp;c. He that giueth her in marriage, doth wel, but he that giueth her not in marriage, doth better, ver.</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is not the word <hi>Counſell,</hi> though they for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage ſo tranſlate it. For the word in Greeke, which is for<note place="margin">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> For the Corinthians had written about the matter, verſe 1. and the Apoſtle giueth his iudgement what is moſt conuenient, and fitting for the preſent time, verſe 26. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this his iudgement hee giueth by the aide and aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, verſe 40. and therefore were the Corinthians highly to reuerence his iudgement, yea, and to ſubmit vnto it, as being giuen from an Apoſtle, hauing Gods Spirit, and one that had obtained mercy of the Lord to bee faithfull, verſe 25. and had the wiſedome of God, to iudge what was beſt to bee done. Thirdly, by ſaying he had no commandement from the Lord, his meaning is, hee had no expreſſe precept in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but, not that he had no commandement at all. For he taught nothing which he had not from the Lord, at leaſt, included in generall precepts, from which, by the direction of Gods Spirit, hee deduced particulars, conſidering and applying them to the circumſtances of times, places, and perſons. This the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth here: for Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded his to be without worldly carefulneſſe, Mat. 6. 25, 31, 34. and to mind heauenly things chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly, ver. 33. Now the Apoſtle at this time grounded his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon theſe precepts, and conſidering the preſent diſtreſſe and troubles of the Church, applyed the ſame to the queſtion of marrying, or not marrying, as is moſt cleare in verſes 32, 33, 34, 35. So then, here is no counſell, or bare aduice, but his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon the queſtion, grounded firſt on Chriſts commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then deliuered faithfully by the guidance of Gods Spirit. This place therefore is nothing for workes of ſupererro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or for counſels, tending as they dreame, to perfection.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are here two things: Firſt, a commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome. Secondly, a commandement vpon ſome. Out of neither of theſe can they build their workes of ſupererro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                  <p>Not out of the firſt. Firſt, they are to proue that theſe Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches were perfect fulfillers of the Morall Law. Secondly, that they did this, which they did, vpon counſell, and not of dutie. Both which they are to proue, before they proue vpon this their commendations, their works ſupererrogatory: which from hence they can neuer doe: for men praiſed for one action, iuſtifieth them not therefore as perfect obſeruers of the Law: Or, for that they doe a voluntarie action praiſe-worthy; that therefore it will follow, they haue done perfectly all neceſſarie duties. Againe, theſe Eunuches, which ſo made themſelues, they did it, the text ſaith, <hi>for the Kingdome of Heauen:</hi> that is, to further their paſſage to Heauen. Now, this euery man, as much as lyeth in him, is bound to doe, and to auoid all the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances, according to that of Chriſt: If thy eye offend thee, plucke it out; if thy hand or foot, cut them off: ſo he that hath the gift of Continencie, and knowes that Marriage would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, muſt make himſelfe an Eunuch, that is, liue as an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch vnmarried: And this not by way of counſell, but as a duty to further his owne ſaluation. Thus, this firſt part helps no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to theſe arrogant workes.</p>
                  <p>Not the ſecond: for it is not a bare counſell, but a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Chriſt, to him that hath the gift of continency, to vſe the ſame: He that can receiue it, that is, he that hath this gift giuen him of God, to abſtaine from marrying, (elſe hee cannot, verſe 11.) let him receiue it; that is, let him abſtaine from marriage. This is Chriſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement. For God giuing vs any gifts, bindeth vs to make true &amp; right vſe of them: euen this very gift of continencie to further vs: for hee giueth no gifts in vaine to any one, but will require the vſe thereof, Luk. 12. 48. and the gift is Gods calling to employ the gift to Gods
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1814:147"/> glory, and to our owne comfort, elſe he will puniſh the neglect, Matth. 25. 15, 25, 27, 30.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gagger</hi> citeth Luk. 10. 25. 1. Cor. 7. 1. Reuel. 4. 3. All idle, and nothing to the purpoſe. Perhaps hee found them quoted ſome-where, and ſo ſet them downe, being ſure his Popiſh cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Readers would neuer examine them, no more then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did.</p>
                  <p>Act. 2. 45. So chap. 4. 34. Theſe places ſpeake of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſelling their goods, and poſſeſſions, and that they were diſtributed to the poore among them, as euery one did need.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Charitie (we know) is a dutie commanded, and ſo farre, no worke of ſupererrogation. Secondly, at ſome time, ſo the caſe may be, that we are to forſake all, for Chriſt and for his Goſpels ſake, ſo as hee that doth it not then, is ſo farre from doing a worke of ſupererrogation, as hee himſelfe cannot bee Chriſts Diſciple, as Chriſt ſpeakes in Luk. 14. 33. <hi>Whoſoeuer he be of you, that forſaketh not all hee hath, hee cannot be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> So then, that act of forſaking all, may bee no worke of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogation, but a neceſſarie dutie. Thirdly, this act here of ſelling and giuing all away to the poore then, was a voluntarie act, a vertue of very high praiſes, yet was it no worke of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> for albeit no particular commandement did bind them hereto, and ſo was it a free worke; yet in generall they were bound to it by the commandement, <hi>To loue our neighbour as our ſelues.</hi> Now, a man will ſell all, Iob 1. 4. to relieue his owne ſelfe, and by the commandement to doe things <hi>honest, iuſt, pure, louely, of good report, matters of vertue and praiſe,</hi> Phil. 4. 8, 9. The preſent neceſſitie of the Church alſo required a more then an ordinarie charitie: and in ſuch a caſe, Chriſtian compaſſion moueth euen deepe pouertie, to be rich in liberalitie, beyond abilitie, 2. Cor. 8. 2, 3. and ſo is it in ſuch a caſe a dutie, which at another time bindeth not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it was the worke of grace in them, it came of God; and what they gaue to the Saints, it was that which God gaue them. The conſideration whereof in <hi>Dauids</hi> infinite preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Temple, made him, not to conceit any worke of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogation,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1814:148"/> but to debaſe himſelfe, and to admire the worke of Gods grace and mercy towards him and his people therein, and to giue God the ſole glory thereof, reade 1. Chron. 29. 13, 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to make this act a worke of ſupererrogation, they muſt proue firſt, that all theſe, that thus ſold and gaue all away, had done perfectly before God all ſuch duties, as they were bound to doe: for this muſt euer bee preſuppoſed, before wee can dreame of any worke of ſupererrogation; but whoſoeuer preſuppoſeth ſo much, doth preſuppoſe that which is moſt falſe, as before is proued, Iam. 3. 2. 1. King. 8. 46. Eccleſ. 7. 20. And therefore there are no workes of ſupererrogation. For the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> Matth. 19. 27. ſpeakes of himſelfe, and of the reſt, that they had forſaken all. But had they perfectly fulfilled the Law, how came it then after, that hee fell ſo fearefully? and that they forſooke Chriſt, and ſo failed of their dutie? yea, did not Chriſt often reproue their ignorance, their weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, their dulneſſe of hearing, and once called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Satan? Therefore men may forſake all, and yet doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no worke of ſupererrogation, as the Apoſtle implyeth, 1. Cor. 13. 3.</p>

                  <hi>XXXII. Propoſition.</hi> Of iuſtification by faith onely.</head>
               <p>BEfore the queſtion bee propounded, the Reader is to know the termes of the queſtion, and what wee meane by them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the word <hi>iuſtification</hi> in this queſtion, we meane not Regeneration, and Sanctification. But we vnderſtand <hi>firſt</hi> the <hi>imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe,</hi> who by his perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence fulfilled the Law, and by his death paid the full ranſome for ſinne, and fully ſatisfied Gods iuſtice; all which God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth, and accounteth as performed by vs, and ſo maketh vs iuſt in Chriſt. Thus the word, <hi>iuſtifieth,</hi> is taken in Rom. 4. 5.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1814:148"/> Whereupon the Apoſtle out of the Pſalme defineth it the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe</hi> of a man, to whom the Lord imputeth righteouſneſſe without workes, Rom. 4. 6. Pſal. 32. 1. <hi>Secondly,</hi> remiſſion and abſolution both from the guilt, as alſo from the puniſhment of ſinne, for Chriſts ſake, Epheſ. 1. 7. and ſo are wee pronounced iuſt: and thus is the word <hi>iuſtifieth,</hi> vſed Rom. 8. 33. Which two wee by faith apprehending, our iuſtification is formally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by <hi>faith</hi> wee doe meane: Firſt, not the faith which is called hiſtoricall, aſſenting and beleeuing that to be true which God ſpeaketh. Secondly, not the extraordinarie faith to work miracles. Thirdly, nor the temporarie faith which is for a time. Fourthly, not any conceited, fantaſticall, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous faith, a fleeting opinion of Gods fauour ſtanding onely in imagination. Fifthly, not an ignorant, fooliſh impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite faith. Sixtly, not an idle fruitleſſe, dead faith, or a ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie faith, alone without other graces: but a <hi>diſtinct, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, liuely, operatiue, obedient, applicatiue</hi> faith, taking hold, as by a hand, of Chriſt, applying him and his benefits, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to our ſelues, as God of his mercie giueth him vnto vs, which we doe call <hi>iuſtifying faith;</hi> and yet not as it is a grace, as other fruits of the Spirit be, or that it hath any vertue, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to iuſtifie vs, but that it is the inſtrument taking hold of Chriſt, and applying him to vs, which is not the propertie of any other grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by <hi>onely,</hi> wee meane that in the act of iuſtification before God, this faith onely, and alone is that grace, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth Chriſt vnto vs, and is the inſtrumentall cauſe of our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; and not that hereby wee doe ſeclude repentance, charitie, and good workes, from being liuely fruits and effects of faith, but no cauſes at all of our iuſtification before God. Yet vnderſtanding theſe tearmes, thus they hold:</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:1814:149"/>
               <p> That a man is not iuſtified before God, onely by faith:</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Confuted by their owne Bible.</head>
                  <p>1. IT ſecludeth from our iuſtification before God, three things. Firſt, the <hi>Law,</hi> from being able to iuſtifie vs, Gal. 3. 11. It is manifeſt that in the Law no man is iuſtified with God, Rom. 8. 3. It was impoſſible by the Law, being weakened by the fleſh. Act. 13. 39. You could not be iuſtified by the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Secondly, <hi>All the workes of the Law,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. &amp; 4. 2. Gal. 2. 16. By the workes of the Law ſhall no fleſH be iuſtified before him, being iuſtified <hi>gratis</hi> by his grace, verſ. 24. Thirdly, <hi>All a mans owne iustice in the ſtate of grace.</hi> For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth aſide his owne iuſtice which is of the Law, Phil. 3. 9. yea, and denyeth himſelfe to bee iuſtified by his owne well-doing: for he ſaith, I am not guilty in conſcience of any thing; but I am not iuſtified herein, 1. Cor. 4. 4. Thus wee ſee what is ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from iuſtifying of vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it aſcribeth iuſtice to faith, Rom. 10. 6. iuſtice which is of faith; and this is the iuſtice of God in faith, Phil. 3. 9. by which faith wee are iuſtified, Rom. 3. 8. Rom. 5. 1. Gal. 2. 24.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the act of iuſtification by faith, it ſecludeth works from it, ſaying, Rom. 3. 28. We account a man to bee iuſtified without the workes of the Law, Rom. 4. 5. Faith is reputed to iuſtice to him that worketh not, Gal. 2. 16. A man is not iuſtified by the workes of the Law, but by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt. How cleere are theſe places for iuſtification by faith only, when they ſeclude workes, and giue it to faith?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it no where exhorteth vs to iuſtification. For iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not a vertue in vs, nor our worke, but the worke of Chriſt, who is our righteouſneſſe, Ier. 23. 6. Rom. 10. 4. 1. Cor. 1. 30. But we are exhorted to beleeue. Now, of faith moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and admirable things are ſpoken, for our euerlaſting comfort. By it, Chriſt dwelleth in vs, Epheſ. 3. 17. By it we are made the children of God, Gal. 3. 26. Ioh. 3. 12. 1. Ioh. 5. 1. By
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1814:149"/> it wee liue, Hab. 2. 4. Rom. 1. 17. Gal. 2. 20. we ſtand. 2. Cor. 1. 24. we walke, 2. Cor. 5. 7. wee haue boldneſſe, acceſſe with confidence to God, Epheſ. 3. 12. Rom. 5. 2. and peace with God, Rom. 5. 1. and without this it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, Heb. 11. 6. For to this is imputed iuſtice, Gal. 3. 6. Rom. 4. 3. and 9. 31. by this are we iuſtified, Rom. 3. 28. Gal. 3. 8. attaining to the righteouſneſſe of God by it, Phil. 3. 9. By this doe we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, 1. Ioh. 5. 4. By this are wee kept vnto ſaluation, 1. Pet. 1. 5. By this wee haue eternall life, Ioh. 3. 36. and are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, Epheſ. 2. 8. wee ſhall not periſh, Ioh. 3. 16. nor come into condemnation, but paſſe from death to life, Ioh. 5. 24. Thus we ſee the excellencie of this faith in Chriſt, which is called the faith of the elect, Tit. 1. 1. the end where of is the ſaluation of our ſoules, 1. Pet. 1. 9. And that wee might not reſt vpon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but vpon Chriſt by faith, the Apoſtle ſaith, Gal. 5. 6. In Ieſus Chriſt, neither circumciſion auaileth any thing, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion, but faith which worketh by loue.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The faith here is of working miracles, and not of iuſtifying faith. Secondly, to haue faith, without charitie, is ſpoken of here by ſuppoſition: for true ſauing faith is that,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1814:150"/> which workes by loue; which wee teach and allow not of a fruitleſſe faith. Thirdly, this is not againſt the tenent, that <hi>faith onely iuſtifieth.</hi> For here is no word of iuſtification: but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of a faith without loue, which iuſtifying faith is not without. For though faith <hi>onely</hi> iuſtifyeth, yet it is not <hi>alone</hi> without charitie, and other fruits, which euer accompany it, to ſhew it to bee ſauing faith, but yet not as any cauſes with it of our iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>Iam. 2. 24. <hi>Ye ſee therefore, how that by workes a man is iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and not by faith onely.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To ſhew the ſence and plaine meaning of theſe words, which are the concluſion from the former diſcourſe, wee muſt conſider:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to whom <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh: hee ſpeaketh to vaine men, verſe 20. which boaſted of their faith, ſaying, they had faith, and yet were without workes, verſe 14. This was the occaſion of the Apoſtles diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſcope, which was not to ſhew, what place faith hath in iuſtification, whether that faith onely iuſtifie before God, for that was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> drift to the Romanes, Rom. 4. 5. but this here is onely to ſhew, what faith it is that ſaueth not, verſe 14.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the faith here ſpoken of and condemned, is ſuch a faith, Firſt, as ſtood onely in words, without workes, like the charitie of ſuch, who ſay to the poore, Goe in peace, be warme, and filled, but yet giue them nothing to warme and fill them, verſe 15, 16. Secondly, a dead faith, verſe 17. 20, 26. Thirdly, an Hiſtoricall faith, which the diuels themſelues haue. Fourthly, a faith contrary to <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith: For his was an operatiue faith, and which he that hath, can ſhew by workes, verſe 18, 21. a faith that worketh by works, ſhewing it ſelfe to bee perfect, that is, true and ſincere, verſe 22. By which faith, <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, it was counted to him for righteouſneſſe, ver. 23. where note, that when righteouſneſſe, which was counted to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> is mentioned, it is aſcribed to his faith, which ſo did ſhew it ſelfe by workes, and not to his deeds done, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes the fruits of this his faith, Heb. 11. 17.</p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:1814:151"/>
                  <p>Therefore all theſe things premiſed, and cleerely manifeſt out of the Text, theſe words in this verſe 24. carry the ſenſe, <hi>Ye ſee therefore</hi> (by all this aforeſaid) how that by workes, that is, by faith ſhewed by workes, that a man is iuſtified, <hi>and not by faith onely,</hi> that is by faith alone, a ſolitarie faith, which hath no workes, of which the vaine man boaſteth: For <hi>onely</hi> here is vſed for <hi>alone.</hi> For when the Greekes place the word <hi>onely</hi> after faith, as here, then it ſignifieth <hi>alone;</hi> but before faith, it ſignifieth <hi>only,</hi>

Alſo when in verſe 21. he had ſpoken of <hi>Abrahams</hi> iuſtification by workes, he by and by ſaith, verſe 22. <hi>Seeſt thou,</hi> how faith wrought by his workes? And then thereupon produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Scripture in verſe 23. to proue, not that <hi>Abrahams</hi> worke was counted to him for righteouſneſſe, (as <hi>Iames</hi> would haue done, if he had intended to teach iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by works) but that it was the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> which did worke by workes, that made him to be reputed righteous before God.</p>
                  <p>Gal. 5. 6. <hi>For in Ieſus Christ, neither Circumciſion auaileth any thing, nor vncircumciſion, but faith which worketh by loue.</hi>

                  <p>Gal. 3. 12. <hi>But the Law is not of faith, but the man that doth them, ſhall liue in them.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The whole courſe of the context is for iuſtification by faith, and againſt iuſtification by works. The eighth verſ. ſpeaks of the iuſtification of the Gentiles through faith. The ninth verſe ſaith, that they that be of faith, are bleſſed with faithfull <hi>Abraham.</hi> The tenth verſe pronounceth them that are of the deeds of the Law, accurſed. The 11. verſe confidently auerreth, that no man is iuſtified by the Law, in the ſight of God, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the reaſon: for the iuſt ſhall liue by faith. In verſe 12. is an argument to refell confidence in workes: For the Law, ſaith he, is not of faith. So as, if we liue by faith, wee cannot liue by the Law; for it propounds life to the doers, but not to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, as the Goſpell doth.</p>

The ſecond is an effect of that good confidence in God, ſpoken of in verſe 21. deſcribing ſuch as haue ſuch boldneſſe towards God, by the true ſignes and fruits of faith; to which he exhorts in verſe 23. ſaying, that it is a commandement of God, that we ſhould beleeue in the name of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The whole Chapter is againſt iuſtification by workes, and for faith, and euen in this very verſe. For what meane theſe words? but to ſhew, that faith by which wee are iuſtified, doth fulfill the Law; ſo as what men would obtaine by the workes of the Law, the ſame they haue by faith in Chriſt, who hath for vs perfectly fulfilled the Law. So the Law is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but by faith eſtabliſhed.</p>

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Confuted by their owne Bible.</head>
                  <p>BY their Bible we doe learne, and it is cleere,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the vnalterable ground of our ſaluation is laid in Ieſus Chriſt, God hauing choſen vs in him, before the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the world, Epheſ. 1. 4. which he wil perfect: for, whom he hath predeſtinated, them alſo he hath called; and whom hee hath called, them alſo he hath iuſtified; and whom he hath iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, them alſo he hath glorified, Rom. 8. 30.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that Chriſt hath taken away all and euery cauſe of damnation, and euery thing that might hinder the ſaluation of ſuch as beleeued in him; as to wit, <hi>ſin.</hi> Hee is made <hi>ſinne</hi> for vs, 2. Cor. 5. 21. the <hi>curſe</hi> of the Law; he hath redeemed vs from the curſe thereof, Gal. 3. 13. and from vnder it, Gal. 4. 5. the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and wrath of God: for we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, Rom. 5. 10, 11 2. Cor. 5. 19. So that there is no damnation to them that are in Chriſt, Rom. 8. 1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that Chriſt is euery thing for vs vnto God, our Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Iuſtice, Sanctification, and Redemption, 1. Cor. 1. 30. yea, in Chriſt, we are made the Iuſtice of God, 2. Cor. 5. 21. So that God iuſtifieth vs with his owne Iuſtice, which cannot bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt. Who therefore ſhall accuſe the elect of God? or who is hee that ſhall condemne? Rom. 8. 33, 34. And if free from accuſation, and condemnation, are they not ſure of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What is it that letteth?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that no power (though they haue many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and many combates) ſhall euer finally ouercome them. The gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt them, Matth. 16. 18. For in the vertue of God, they are kept by faith to ſaluation, 1. Pet. 1. 5. and are in all power ſtrengthened, according to the might of his glory, in all patience &amp; longanimitie with ioy, Col. 1. 11.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:1814:153"/> Chriſt promiſeth not to caſt forth his, Ioh. 6. 37, 40 and he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, that none ſhall plucke vs out of his hands, Ioh 10. 28. <hi>Not Satan,</hi> for Chriſt hath ouercome him, Matth. 4. Heb. 2. 14. <hi>Not the world:</hi> for he hath ouercome it alſo, Ioh. 16. 33. <hi>Not falſe Teachers:</hi> for it is not poſſible that the elect ſhould bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into errour, Matth. 24. 24. meaning totally and finally. <hi>Not our ſinnes:</hi> for the bloud of Chriſt hath cleanſed vs from all ſinne, 1. Ioh. 1. 7. and in him we haue redemption, the remiſſion of our ſinnes, Col. 1. 14. Epheſ. 1. 7. See alſo Heb. 8. 12 &amp; 9. 14. <hi>Not the terrour and curſe of the Law:</hi> for hee hath fulfilled it for vs, and remoued the curſe, Gal. 4. 5. &amp; 3. 13. <hi>Not our once being vnder the power of darkneſſe:</hi> for God hath deliuered vs from our enemies, Luk. 1. 74. and from the power of darkneſſe, and tranſlated vs into the kingdome of the Sonne of his loue, Col. 1. 13. <hi>Nor Gods once former diſpleaſure againſt vs:</hi> for when we were impious, Rom. 5. when wee were ſinners, Chriſt dyed for vs, verſes 6. 8. and when we were enemies, we by Chriſts death were reconciled to God, verſe 10. and haue receiued reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, verſe 11. <hi>Not any thing that may fall out after reconciliation.</hi> For, if when we were Enemies, we were reconciled, much more being reconciled, ſhal we be ſaued in the life of him, Rom. 5. 10. <hi>No, not Gods iuſt deſerued wrath for our often falls.</hi> For, if when we were ſinners, Chriſt dyed for vs; much more therefore now being iuſtified by his bloud, ſhall wee be ſaued from wrath by him, Rom. 5. 8, 9. 1. Theſ. 1. 10. <hi>Not the Law of ſinne captiuing vs, ſo as we cannot doe that which wee would, but doe often that which wee would not.</hi> For Ieſus Chriſt ſhall deliuer vs from the body of this death, Rom. 7. 24, 25. <hi>Not tribulation, diſtreſſe, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, nakedneſſe, danger, perſecution, nor the ſword, though wee were killed for his ſake all the day long.</hi> For to vs it is giuen for Chriſt, not onely that wee ſhould beleeue in him, but alſo that we ſuffer for his name, Phil. 1. 28. And in all theſe things wee ouercome; becauſe of him that hath loued vs, Rom. 8. 37. and becauſe God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer his to bee tempted aboue that which they are able: but will alſo make with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation iſſue, that you may be able to ſuſtaine, 1. Cor. 10. 13.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, there is nothing poſſible that can ſeparate vs
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:1814:153"/> from the charity of God in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord. For I am ſure, ſaith the Apoſtle, that <hi>neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, neither things preſent, nor things to come, neither might, nor height, nor depth, nor other creature ſhall be able to doe it,</hi> Rom. 8. 38, 39. For we know, that to them that loue God, all things co-operate vnto good, to ſuch as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to purpoſe are called to be Saints, Rom. 8. 28. And Chriſt Ieſus is able to ſaue for euer them that goe by him to God, Heb. 7. 25. hee being entred into Heauen, now appearing to the countenance of God for vs, Heb. 9. 24. who is on Gods right hand making interceſſion for vs, Rom. 8. 34. So that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly certaine, that thoſe that bee Chriſts ſhall not periſh, Ioh. 3. 15. nor come into iudgement, but paſſe from death to life, Ioh. 5. 24.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, their Bible teacheth, not onely theſe things in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; but alſo how euery true beleeuer may particularly be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that he hath his part in theſe things, and be certaine of his owne ſaluation; and that is by Chriſts Spirit, and by the grace of faith, wrought by the ſame Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>by the Spirit.</hi> For the Spirit himſelfe giueth teſtimonie to our ſpirit, that wee are the ſonnes of God, Rom. 8. 16. This Spirit of God wee receiue, that wee may know the things that of God are giuen to vs, 1. Cor. 2. 12. Hence it is, that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, In this we know that we abide in him, and he in vs, becauſe hee of his Spirit hath giuen to vs, 1. Ioh. 4. 13. and 3. 24. What can be more certaine then knowledge, and that knowledge which is of Gods Spirit? whoſe teſtimony is moſt infallible: for it is the teſtimonie of God himſelfe, and the Spirit of truth, Ioh. 14. 17. 1. Ioh. 5 6. It is alſo Gods <hi>pledge</hi> to vs, 2. Cor. 5. 5. and 1. 22. Epheſ. 1. 14. and his <hi>Signet,</hi> with which we are ſigned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Day of Redemption, Epheſ. 1. 13. and 4. 30. Now Gods Spirit being truth, being Gods owne witneſſe, being his owne pledge, in euery true beleeuers heart, and his owne ſignet and ſeale, is hee not certaine and ſure of his ſaluation? Will any man queſtion the truth of an earthly Kings word, his hand and ſeale ſo affirming any thing to be as hee ſaith? How much leſſe the Word, hand and Seale of the King of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:1814:154"/> Heauen, bearing witneſſe to euery true beleeuer, that hee is the child of God; yea, and making him to ſpeake to God as to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; ſo to call him by the name of Father, Rom. 8. 15. Gal. 4. 6. then which, what greater aſſurance of ſaluation can there be?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>by faith;</hi> which maketh the party which hath it, to know that he hath it, 1. Cor. 13. 5. and that which it belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, to be certaine to the beleeuer: ſo as he can ſay, We know that hee will raiſe vs vp, 2. Cor. 4. 14. We know that wee haue eternall life, 1. Ioh. 5. 13. and we know, that we haue a building of God, eternall in Heauen, 2. Cor. 5. 1. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, We are bold alwayes, verſe 6. So as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth not to wauer or to doubt, Iam. 1. 6. So S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 8. For ſaith is the ſubſtance of things to be hoped for, and the argument of things not appearing, Heb. 11. 1. Which could not be, vnleſſe there were certainty in it; yea, ſo certaine, faith maketh things to be to beleeuers, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Wee walke by ſaith, and not by ſight,</hi> hauing before ſpoken of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant boldneſſe, and alſo by and by after touching their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of future happineſſe, 2. Cor. 5. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Moreouer,</hi> this grace of faith giueth a particular aſſurance to him that hath it, and applyeth that to himſelfe which hee beleeueth. Therefore beleeuing in Chriſt, and receiuing him, are made both one, Ioh. 1. 12. Now, he that receiueth a thing from another for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, is to lay hold on it, and ſo to take it to himſelfe. So belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, is a laying hold and applying Chriſt, and his benefits, and all promiſes of ſaluation made in Chriſt to a mans ſelfe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. Whereupon it is, that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of faith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth to apprehend eternall life, 1. Tim. 6. 12. Alſo the more fully to expreſſe this particular aſſurance and application, in Ioh. 6. to eate and to drinke Chriſt, is made the ſame with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in him. To beleeue in Chriſt (ſaith Saint <hi>Auſten</hi>) is to<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In Ioan. tract.</hi> 25. &amp; 26.</note> eate the bread of Life: He that beleeueth, eateth. Beleeue, and thou eateſt. Now, can any thing be more aſſured, and more neerely applyed to a man, that it is his infallibly, then that which he hath eaten? And if to beleeue in Chriſt, be the eating of him, and the eating aſſureth him that eateth him, to liue for euer, Ioh. 6. 51, 58. then faith doth aſſure him that beleeueth in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:1814:154"/> Chriſt, that he hath Chriſt, and all the benefits of his death and Paſſion, for his eternall ſaluation, as he that hath eaten bread, hath the benefit of it, to the ſuſtentation of corporall life. Of this liuely and certaine application of faith, the Fathers ſpeake. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſaith, that ſaith <hi>ſent vp, layeth hold on Chriſt. Chryſoſtome</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tract.</hi> 50. on <hi>Iohn.</hi> On <hi>Marke hom.</hi> 10. On <hi>Luk l. 6. c. 8. Li. de reſur. Cor.</hi>
                     </note> ſaith, <hi>Let vs beleeue, and we ſee Ieſus preſent before vs. Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, That <hi>by faith Christ is touched, and is ſeene. Tertullian</hi> ſaith, That <hi>by faith Chriſt is digested.</hi> Now, if Chriſt by faith be laid hold on, ſeene preſent, touched, and as food digeſted, it doth, according to the meaſure thereof, effectually apply him, and giueth particular aſſurance of Saluation, which is obtained by Chriſt; though we haue neither miracle, nor extraordinarie reuelation to tell vs, that we are ſaued. <hi>Furthermore,</hi> faith is that which receiueth the promiſe, Gal. 3. 14. It goeth out of a mans ſelfe to fetch all that it beleeueth, concerning ſaluation from God; moſt fully knowing that whatſoeuer God promiſeth, he is able to performe it, Rom. 4. 21. Hence is it, that by faith which applyeth the promiſe, and beleeueth that God is true of his word, and able alſo to make it good, aboue all that we deſire, or vnderſtand, Epheſ. 3. 20. we are aſcertained of that which we beleeue; neither doth our faith ſtagger, but maketh vs moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, while it is fixed on God, on his Word, on his will made knowne by his Word and promiſe, on the truth of that alſo which he once hath ſpoken, &amp; on his almightie power to make it good accordingly. But God hath promiſed to euery true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, Act. 10. 43. and euerlaſting life, Ioh. 3. 15. Thus hauing ſpoken, his will and good pleaſure is hereby knowne, this word will hee keepe, and his power will make it good: All which, true faith applyeth to him that hath it, as ſpoken to him (for in this, faith excelleth all other graces) and ſo maketh him certaine of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and of euerlaſting life, which we in our Creed profeſſe to beleeue, not onely that there is remiſſion of ſinnes, the reſurrection of the body, and the life euerlaſting: but euery true beleeuer by faith ſaith, that his ſinnes are remitted, his body ſhall riſe againe, as <hi>Iob</hi> was perſwaded, and that hee ſhall haue life euerlaſting: For to beleeue them to be, and not to apply them, is not a iuſtifying
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:1814:155"/> faith, but ſuch a faith as is in reprobates, euen the faith of deuils.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> this ſauing faith bringeth forth ſuch fruits, as wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime to all, that faith is a grace of certainty. It maketh a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that he ſhall not be confounded, Rom. 10. 11 to haue affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and acceſſe with confidence, Epheſ. 3. 12. Now, where there is aſſiance, and confidence, there is much certainty in that grace which worketh theſe. It worketh alſo hope; now hope maketh vs glory, and confoundeth not, Rom. 5. 2, 5. and is the anchor of the ſoule ſure and firme, Heb. 6. 19. yea hope is ſaid to haue glory and confidence, Heb. 3. 6. If hope then bee ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, ſure and firme, as that we are thereby confident, yea glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, as if we had in poſſeſſion that which we expect to haue, and neuer confoundeth, nor maketh vs aſhamed, that is, faileth vs not of that which wee looke for, but wee finde ſurely what hope expecteth: then much more are wee made confident by faith it ſelfe, and particularly aſſured of that which God hath promiſed, euen remiſſion of ſinnes, and eternall ſaluation, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hope is the fruit of faith.</p>

And can they thus allow it in hope, which is but a fruit of faith, and hath all it firme and ſure certainly from faith, and not admit it in faith it in ſaith it ſelfe?

                  <p>Before I come to the obiected Scriptures, ſome things are needfull to be knowne, both more cleerely to ſhew that which we hold, that we may not be miſtaken; as alſo to helpe to the better anſwering of ſuch places as be brought forth againſt this particular aſſurance of a mans ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that this iuſtifying, ſauing, and applicatiue faith, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending in it both hiſtoricall and temporarie faith, is euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:1814:156"/> with other graces of Gods Spirit: as with <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 13, 14. and 5. 1, 6. with <hi>hope,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 21. with <hi>Loue and Charitie,</hi> Gal. 5. 6. Epheſ. 6. 23. 2. Tim. 1. 14. 1. Theſ. 5. 8. 2. Theſ. 3. 6. with <hi>holineſſe and ſanctification,</hi> Iude, verſ. 20. 2. Theſ. 2. 13. with <hi>puritie of heart,</hi> 1. Tim. 1. 5. Act. 15. 9. with <hi>a good conſcience,</hi> 1. Tim. 1. 5, 19. <hi>ioy,</hi> Phil. 1. 25. with <hi>obedience,</hi> Reu. 14. 13. with <hi>good workes,</hi> Iam. 2. 22. Heb. 11. with <hi>open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 13. Act. 4. 20. Rom. 10. 10. with <hi>Prayer,</hi> Iam. 1. 6. and 5. 15. Iude, verſe 20. Rom. 10. 14. with <hi>godly ſorrow, feare, holy reuenge</hi> on a mans ſelfe, 1. Cor. 7. 11. with <hi>patience</hi> in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, Iam. 1. 3. 2. Theſ. 1. 4. Heb. 6. 12. Reuel. 13. 10. and with many other vertues, 1. Cor. 7. 11. 2. Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7. 2. Tim. 2. 22. and 3. 10. 1. Tim. 4. 12. Reuel. 2. 19. 1. Cor. 6. 11. So that ſuch as haue this faith, are no <hi>Solifidians,</hi> as our Aduerſaries pleaſe in malice to call vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the graces haue their proper operations, which this faith doth not hinder, but rather they haue their ſtrength from faith, and by it are ſet on worke, ſo as it and they toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make vs that we neither ſhall be barren, nor without fruit in the knowledge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes, but hereby make our calling and election ſure, 2. Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10. For whileſt faith holdeth Chriſt, and in him apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth eternall life; hope expecteth the accompliſhment; pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence endureth trials; loue exerciſeth vs in duties of obedience, and workes of mercy; feare keepes vs from ſinne, and aweth vs, that we dare not diſpleaſe God; a good conſcience comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs; humilitie makes vs lowly in our owne eyes; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſinne makes vs to fly the cauſes, and occaſions thereof, as ill companie, counſels, and examples to euill. Godly ſorrow vpon our falls, exerciſeth vs in faſting, praying and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; zeale makes vs take reuenge vpon our ſelues, when wee haue treſpaſſed, and to oppoſe ſtoutly wickednes in others, and ſo forth in all the reſt of Gods graces, whatſoeuer they be: for as faith is ſaid to worke by loue; ſo doth it worke by hope, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, humilitie, and all other vertues which accompanie it; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer neglecting the meanes which God preſcribeth in the way to heauen, nor abating the power of theſe other graces &amp; gifts
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:1814:157"/> of God, nor withholding them from their proper workes, wherein they are to be imployed, vpon any vaine confidence of ſaluation by Chriſt, or imaginatie aſſurance of heauen. Hence is it, that ſuch as in the Scripture are ſaid to beleeue, are ſaid alſo to feare God, to be charitable, to be iuſt, to eſchew euill, to doe good, to faſt and pray, to continue in the Word, to heare it with an honeſt heart, to come to the Sacraments, and ſo forth. See this in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was well aſſured of eternall life, of which he could confidently ſpeake, 2. Tim. 4. 8. 2. Cor. 5. 1. Rom. 8. 38, 39. And yet neuertheleſſe he had care to keepe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God and man, Act. 24. 16. endeuouring to pleaſe God, 2. Cor. 5. 9. and had excellent vertues accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his faith, 2. Tim. 3. 10, 11. <hi>Dauid</hi> had particulat aſſurance of pardon of ſinne, 2. Sam. 12. 13. yet he afterward prayed for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie feruently, Pſal. 51. and Chriſt knew his houre, yet did auoid dangers. <hi>Hezekias</hi> knew that he ſhould liue fifteene yeeres, yet vſed the meanes of life. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was ſure of ſafety, yet would haue meanes vſed, Act. 27. 31.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that neither this faith, nor any of theſe graces are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this life: for the Scripture ſpeaketh of <hi>degrees of Faith,</hi> Matth. 8. 26. and 15. 28. Rom. 4. 21. and of the <hi>increaſe of faith,</hi> Luk. 15. 5. 2. Theſ. 1. 3. 2. Cor. 10. 15. Rom. 1. 17. So likewiſe of the increaſe of <hi>knowledge,</hi> Col. 1. 10. of <hi>loue,</hi> Phil. 1. 9. of <hi>workes of charitie,</hi> 1. Theſ. 4. 10. of <hi>walking and pleaſing God,</hi> 1. Theſ. 4. 1. of <hi>grace,</hi> 2. Pet. 3. 18. and ſo of all other vertues which doe increaſe as the whole Church doth increaſe, as the Apoſtle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, Epheſ. 2. 21. So that they are more at one time then at another, in ſuch as haue them; and doe increaſe by degrees, though not alike in all.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, firſt, that ordinary meanes are preſcribed by God, not onely for the firſt begetting; but alſo for the increaſe and continuance of all theſe graces, to wit, the Word, 1 Pet. 2. 1, 2. the Sacraments, and Prayer, which therefore the godly doe euer make vſe of, Act. 2. 42, 46. Secondly, that the godly are ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found fault with, reproued, admoniſhed, and threatned for failing in their duties. Thirdly, that they doe ſo vilifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and renounce all righteouſneſſe in themſelues, and fly to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:1814:157"/> Gof for mercy through Chriſt. Fourthly, that there are ſo many exhortations, as meanes to vrge them to their duties, in which they are weake and defectiue. Fifthly, that promiſes are made with conditions annexed, to ſtirre them vp to their duties.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that with theſe imperfections of graces, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the moſt holieſt perſons naturall corruption, which is ſometime ſo ſtrong, as it not onely hindereth the worke of theſe graces (ſo as a regenerate man cannot doe the good hee would) but alſo is drawne to do that which he would not, Rom. 7. 15, 18. Hence it is, firſt, that the beſt haue ſometime broken forth into foule enormities, as may be ſeene in <hi>Dauid, Solomon,</hi> and others. Secondly, that God ſo threatens &amp; chaſtiſeth them, as meanes to awake and reclaime them. Thirdly, that they ſo<note place="margin">See an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſcourſe of this in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Abbots</hi> anſwer to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop—in this point of the certainty of ſaluation, <hi>pag. 257.</hi>

                     </gap> cry and call, as if they were forſaken. Fourthly, that this faith, and theſe graces are not ſeen, nor felt to bee at all times alike in operation; but ſo weakened through ſtrength of corruption, &amp; ſo brought vnder, as if they had clean loſt their vertues, and faith in a ſort had failed; which in ſome agony of ſpirit, cauſeth them to vtter ſome vncomfortable words, ſauouring rather of deſperation, then of any hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, euen as Chriſt on the Croſſe, crying, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? And as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſometimes did in the Pſalms, Pſ. 13. 1. &amp; 6. 1, 6. &amp; 22. 1, 2. &amp; 31. 22. &amp; 38. 1, 8. &amp; 55. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, that albeit the imperfection of graces, and corruptions of nature doe weaken thus the power of faith, and other accompanying graces, much troubling the ſoule of a true Beleeuer; yet doe none of them hereby alter their nature, nor change their qualitie; but faith holdeth its hold, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time as doth a Palſie hand, and ſtriueth againſt doubting, till it conquer in the combate, as may bee ſeene in <hi>Dauids</hi> conflicts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he will ſay to his ſoule (as he doth in a Pſalme) <hi>Why are thou ſo diſquieted within me? yet truſt in God.</hi> Secondly, he will runne to God in Prayer, which is the true fruit of faith. Thirdly, he will profeſſe his faith, and truſt in God. So <hi>Iob</hi> in his greateſt terrours, ſaid, If he kill mee, yet will I truſt in him. So that faith giueth aſſurance in the midſt of troubles, and ſaueth <hi>Daniel</hi> in the very den of Lyons, and other in the midſt of a ſiery Ouen.</p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:1814:158"/>
                  <p>Therefore, for all the defects of graces, and power of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ouer-ſwaying too often; yet ſeeing they deſtroy not faith in the elect, nor annihilate their graces, they are moſt certaine of their ſaluation in the end.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, but grant the word to be vnderſtood of a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, yet is it nothing againſt the aſſurance of ſaluation: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking thus of himſelfe, was moſt certain that he was no Reprobate, 2. Cor. 13. 6. but one ſure of his ſaluation, Rom. 8. 38, 39. 2. Tim. 1. 12. &amp; 4. 8. Gal. 5. 20. as is alſo cleere out of the 26. verſe, going before this obiected place: <hi>I therefore ſo runne, not as vncertainly; ſo fight I, not as one that beateth the ayre.</hi> Therefore ſpeaking ſo aſſuredly of ſaluation in the former verſe, he cannot be vnderſtood here, as making doubt thereof; for ſo ſhould he be made to ſpeake contraries. But the Apoſtle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that with his faith of the promiſes of aſſurance of ſaluation, he did ioyne the meanes, the more to further, and the more to ſtrengthen his ſaid aſſurance: For he knew, and taught, and ſo doe we, that the vſe of the meanes to ſaluation, weakeneth not the aſſurance; but rather confirmeth it: and therefore doe wee that truely beleeue, vſe ſuch meanes carefully and conſtantly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this place will not afford any good reaſon againſt the aſſurance of ſaluation. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſure of his ſaluation, and hee vſed ſuch lawfull meanes as might further him in the way; and that he might not be a <hi>Caſtaway,</hi> hee oppoſed his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not liuing carnally ſecure, nor vainely preſumptuous; nor
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:1814:158"/> did he neglect to doe what he ought to doe. Will it hence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that he doubted of his ſaluation? He profeſſed as you ſee before, the contrarie. Faith, in the vſe of the meanes, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not, but gets aſſurance, and groweth more conſident.</p>
                  <p>Rom. 11. 20. <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by faith; bee not high-minded, but feare, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this place, ſpoken to the Church of Rome, will afford the concluſion, that wee cannot be certaine of ſaluation, but that they which now ſtand, may fall away: how commeth it to paſſe, that Papiſts ſo bragge of the infallibilitie of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches not falling?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, feare here is oppoſed to high-mindedneſſe, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſecuritie, and not to the aſſurance of ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle taketh not hereby away the aſſurance of ſaluation, but preſcribeth the meanes of ſecuring vs therein, that we fall not away. For the true feare of God, and humilitie of Spirit, will greatly awe vs, and keepe vs from departing from God, Ier. 32. 40.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh to them, as to a mixt company, and as they were outwardly profeſſors of the faith of Chriſt; and not as the Elect of God, and all true and ſincere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, of which the queſtion is. For theſe cannot finally fall away, but the other may, &amp; ſo be vncertaine of their ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Phil. 2. 12. <hi>Worke out your ſaluation with feare and trembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This place may be, and is againſt the vaine ſecuritie of ſaluation; but not againſt true and ſound aſſurance thereof.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, the Apoſtle aſſureth them of ſaluation, by ſaying, <hi>your ſaluation,</hi> making it theirs already.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he vttereth nothing that might cauſe doubting; but onely exhorteth them to doe that which they ought to doe, for the better aſſurance of their ſaluation, that is, to worke it out with feare and trembling: thus warning them hereby to take heed of vaine preſumption, and careleſſe ſecuritie, and not to cauſe them to liue in doubt of their ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we muſt know that there is a two-fold feare; The one a ſeruile, diſtruſting, diſcouraging, diſtracting legall feare, begotten by the ſpirit of bondage, and is oppoſite to ſauing
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:1814:159"/> faith, and ſpirituall comfort, from which feare euery where the godly are dehorted Eſa. 35. 4. &amp; 41. 10. &amp; 43. 1. &amp; 54. 4, 14. Luk. 12. 32. This feare Chriſt redeemeth vs from, Luk. 1. 74. Heb. 2. 15. the Spirit of God freeth vs from, Rom. 8. 15. 2. Tim. 1. 7. and perfect loue caſts it out, 1. Ioh. 4. 18. The other is a filiall feare, carefull and louing, a feare of awefull reuerence, begotten by the Spirit of adoption, euer attending, as a handmaid, on ſauing faith. To this the faithfull are exhorted, Luk. 12. 5. 1. Pet. 2. 17. Reuel. 14. 7. And this feare may be with reioycing, as in Pſal. 2. 11. <hi>Serue the Lord with feare, and reioyce vnto him with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi> To which words in that Pſalm the Apoſtle here alludeth. And he that alwayes thus feareth, is pronounced bleſſed, Prou. 28. 14. And of this feare ſpeaketh the Apoſtle in this place to the <hi>Philippians;</hi> which feare doth not hinder, but furthereth mans aſſurance of ſaluation, keeping him from departing from God, as before is noted out of Ier. 32. 40. and from preſuming vpon their owne ſtrength, and to reſt vpon God, and in him to be ſtrong, Epheſ. 6. 10. as in the next verſe, Phil. 2. 13. is euident. See for this, <hi>Auſtins</hi> expoſition, <hi>lib. de gra. &amp; lib. arb. cap. 9. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, apud Ambroſ. Epiſt.</hi> 84.</p>
                  <p>Prou. 28. 14. <hi>Bleſſed is he, that feareth alway.</hi>

                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:1814:159"/>
                  <p>Prou. 20. 9. <hi>Who can ſay, I haue made my heart cleane, I am pure from my ſinne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is true, that either he can make himſelf pure &amp; clean by his own power, neither that he is pure by any inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, neither that hee is made perfectly pure in this life by Gods Spirit, whereby he is in a meaſure, not wholy ſanctified.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, yet a true Beleeuer can ſay, that faith purgeth the heart, Act. 15. 9. that by the bloud of Chriſt he is cleanſed from all his ſinnes, 1. Ioh. 1. 7. that he is ſanctified, Heb. 10. 10. and alſo by the Spirit, 1. Pet. 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thus being ſanctified, he is ſure that he hath the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, Ioh. 14. 17. and that he is iuſtified, Rom. 8. 1, 9. and then is he certain, that he ſhall be glorified, Rom. 8. 30, 33.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and although this ſanctification be not perfect in this life; yet this hindereth not our ſaith, to aſſure vs of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe faith taketh hold of the truth of Gods promiſes made to euery true beleeuer in Chriſt, who is our Wiſdome, our Iuſtification, our Sanctification and Redemption, 1. Cor. 1. 30. who hath perfected for euer by one offering, them that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, Heb. 10. 14. and ſo hath obtained euerlaſting redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for vs, Heb. 9. 12. So as though no man can ſay, that his heart is perfectly cleane, nor that hee is pure wholly from ſinne in himſelfe, or by himſelfe: yet is he in and by Chriſt moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; ſo as he need not doubt of his ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Iob 9. 20. <hi>If I iustifie my ſelfe, my owne mouth ſhall condemne me, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. 1. Iob</hi> here diſclaimeth his owne righteouſneſſe; hee was then no Papiſt. Secondly, this is no argument againſt the aſſurance of his ſaluation: For though there be no righteouſnes of a mans ſelfe, nor the righteouſneſſe of the Law to aſſure him of his ſaluation, yet is there another righteouſneſſe, which is called <hi>the righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> Rom. 4. 13. by which a true Beleeuer is certaine of his ſaluation: And though <hi>Iob</hi> thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his owne righteouſneſſe, yet was he aſſured of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, yea and ſo aſſured, as in the midſt of his ſo grieuous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, he ſeemed through it to triumph, Iob 19. 25, 26, 29. neither could his faith bee made to let goe its hold: for
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:1814:160"/> hee ſaid, <hi>If hee kill mee, yet will I truſt in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Cor. 4. 4. <hi>For I know nothing by my ſelfe, yet am I not thereby iustified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What is this againſt aſſurance of ſaluation? What if <hi>Paul</hi> was no Papiſt, reiecting iuſtification by workes? muſt it needs follow, that he had therefore no aſſurance of ſaluation? It is cleere, as before is proued, that <hi>Paul</hi> was certaine of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Therefore hence to fetch an vncertainty thereof, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the plaine euidences of his aſſurance, and ſo is a lewd col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle here, though hee knowes himſelfe not iuſtified by his owne innocent liuing and righteouſneſſe, Phil. 3. 9. yet was he ſure that by Chriſt he was iuſtified, Gal. 2. 16, 20. &amp; 5. 20. hauing attained to that righteouſneſſe through faith, Phil. 3. 9. Of his iuſtification he doubted not, for hee here abſolutely denyeth himſelfe to know as certainly, that hee is iuſtified by Chriſt, Gal. 2. 20. Phil. 1. 19, 20. Therefore though by the firſt he cannot aſſure himſelfe of ſaluation, yet may hee by the latter, as indeed he was, Rom. 8. 11, 30, 39.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not here of the iuſtification of his perſon, but of his office, as hee was an Apoſtle, and a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Corinthians, and of the Gentiles. For when he ſaith, <hi>I know nothing by my ſelfe,</hi> he meaneth it of the outward diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the miniſterie, wherein his owne conſcience bare him witneſſe, that hee had beene faithfull, as hee alſo ſpeakes in 2. Cor. 1. 12. and 2. 17. and 4. 2, 5. and had not failed of his duty, to his witting; yet could he not hereby iuſtifie himſelfe, nor would hee iudge himſelfe, nor regarded hee to be iuſtified of other, but referred the iudgement thereof vnto God, who, ſaith he, iudged him, to wit, that hee was faithfull, by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of his owne conſcience. So as here is no argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt aſſurance; but rather for his aſſurance, as knowing, that God iudged aright of him, though neither himſelfe, nor other could ſo iudge of him.</p>
                  <p>Phil. 19. 12. <hi>Who can vnderſtand his errours? Cleanſe thou mee from ſecret faults.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:1814:160"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It followes not, that becauſe a man cannot know all his errours and hidden faults, therefore he is not ſure of his ſaluation. For as the knowledge of them all, (if ſo a man could know them) would not giue aſſurance of ſaluation (for the ſight of ſinnes ſheweth to vs miſery, and not hope of felicitie:) ſo the not vnderſtanding them, cannot debarre a man from the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſaluation, becauſe ſaluation is purchaſed by Chriſt, who cleanſeth vs of all ſinne, ſecret, as well as open, vnknowne, as well as knowne; and faith, taking hold of the promiſe of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes through Chriſt, aſſureth of ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this ſpeech, that none can vnderſtand his errours, being vnderſtood of all men whatſoeuer, then it comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes, Dauid,</hi> holy <hi>Simeon, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> with other holy men, who yet had aſſurance of their ſaluation, as our Aduerſaries deny not: And therefore the not vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all the errours of a mans life, is no hindrance of the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>1. Cor. 10. 12. <hi>Let him that thinks that hee ſtandeth, take heed lest he fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Good counſell to vſe meanes, as wary circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; diligent endeuour to perſeuere, is no argument againſt the certainty of ſaluation: for ſound confidence cauſeth no neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in any good meanes: as we may ſee in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and others aſſured of eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes to the preſumptuous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited; for hee ſaith, Let him that <hi>thinketh</hi> hee ſtandeth, take heed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, grant it ſpoken to the beſt aſſured; yet here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt that aſſurance; for the Apoſtle ſaith not, Leſt hee fall away, as ſpeaking of Apoſtacie finall, but of falling into ſinnes, leſt they prouoke God to puniſh them, as he did the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if yet further it bee yeelded of falling away, then it is to be vnderſtood onely of ſuch among them, as might fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally periſh; for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake to a mixt company, and not of the Elect among them: for in verſe 13. following, the Apoſtle ſtrengtheneth their aſſurance very fully againſt all temptations.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:1814:161"/> Therefore take this place howſoeuer they pleaſe, yet it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the certainty of ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>1. Pet. 1. 17. <hi>Paſſe the time of your ſoiourning here in feare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Feare that is filiall, attendeth on faith, keepeth a man with God from falling from him, and ſo rather aſſureth them, then any way cauſeth doubting of ſaluation. The anſwer before to Phil. 2. 12. is a full anſwer to this place.</p>

                  <head>Places of Scripture obiected, that iuſtifying faith once had, may bee loſt, and a true beleeuer finally periſh: And therefore no certaine aſſurance of ſaluation.</head>
                  <p>Before the obiected places be produced, it is good to know the truth of the Tenent, and how it is to be vnderſtood, to wit, <hi>That the faith of the Elect once had, cannot vtterly be loſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Faith is diuerſly taken in the Scripture. <hi>Firſt,</hi> for hiſtoricall faith, a bare and naked knowledge of God, with an aſſent to the truths of God, and profeſſion of Religion, but without liuely effects and fruits; this is a dead faith, Iam. 2. 17, 24. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> it is taken for a certaine perſwaſion of ſome wondrous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to bee done through Gods aſſiſting power, 1. Cor. 13. 2. Matth. 17. 20. Acts 14 9. This is called a miraculous faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is taken for knowledge with a ioyfull aſſent of the minde, Matth. 13. 20. hearing gladly, Ioh. 5. 35. yea and doing many things, Mar. 16. 20. But this endureth but for a ſeaſon, Ioh. 5. 35. Mar. 4. 17. for that it hath not roote in him that hath it, Matth. 13. 21. wanting moiſture, Luk. 8. 6. the heart being as ſtony ground, Mar. 4. 16. and ſo, in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for the Word, it withereth, and ſuch a Beleeuer falleth away, Luk. 8. 13. and is offended, Mar. 4. 17. This is called tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie faith. Of theſe faiths the queſtion is not: for hiſtoricall is alſo in Deuils as well as men, Iam. 2. Faith of miracles laſted but for a time, and was the faith of ſome few. Faith tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie may be loſt; the Scriptures are plaine for it.</p>
                  <p>But the faith which we ſay cannot be loſt, is that precious faith, 1. Pet. 1. 1. that vnfained faith, which is accompanied with a pure heart, a good conſcience, 1. Tim. 1. 5. working by loue,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:1814:161"/> Gal. 5. 6. that faith which iuſtifieth, Rom. 5. 1. which ſaueth, Eph. 2. 8. by which Chriſt dwelleth in vs, Eph. 3. 17. and by which the world is ouercome, 1. Ioh. 5. 4. through which, by the power of God, we are kept vnto ſaluation, 1. Pet. 1. 5. This is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the moſt holy faith, Iude, verſ. 20. and is properly the faith of Gods Elect, Tit. 1. 1.</p>
                  <p>This faith may be ſhaken, and the power of it ſometime very greatly weakened, and ſometime be ſo made to languiſh, as the true beleeuer may cry with the afflicted Father in the Goſpell, <hi>Lord, I beleeue, helpe thou my vnbeliefe,</hi> Mar. 9. 24. the ſenſe thereof being very little, and the power thereof hardly felt, for a time the partie being as it were in a ſwoune or traunce, through the force of the temptation. But yet neuertheleſſe it is not loſt totally nor finally, ſo as <hi>that the elect Beleeuers cannot periſh vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly:</hi> which is proued not onely from all which hath beene ſaid before, for proofe of the certainty of ſaluation, but alſo by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifold reaſons of great force to perſwade hereto.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>From God the Father,</hi> and thus, Firſt, <hi>from his decree</hi> which altereth not: for in him is no variablenes, nor ſhadow of turning, Iam. 1. 17. he changeth not, Mal. 3. 6. no more doth his decree, but his counſell ſhall ſtand. Now God hath decreed who ſhall be ſaued, Rom. 8. 30. and he hath decreed that ſuch ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, Act. 13. 48. that they ſhall be holy and blameleſſe in loue, Eph. 1. 4. be confirmed to the Image of his Sonne, Rom. 8. 29. walke in good workes, Eph. 2. 10. bring forth fruit, and that the ſame ſhall remaine, Ioh. 15. 16. Therefore by this decree of God, neither they nor theſe their graces ſhall finally decay. Secondly, <hi>From his Couenant,</hi> which is an euerlaſting Couenant, not to turne away from vs to do vs good, but to put his feare in our hearts, that we ſhall not depart from him, Ier. 32. 40. Therefore by this euerlaſting Couenant they cannot periſh. Thirdly, <hi>From his gifts,</hi> among which, is faith to beleeue in Chriſt, to ſuffer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for him, Phil. 1. 29. But theſe gifts and callings of God are without repentance, Rom. 11. 29. Therefore can they neuer be loſt, nor they that haue them, periſh. Fourthly, <hi>From Gods working</hi> all in vs, both the will and the deed, Phil. 2. 13. and all things for vs, Eſay 26. 12. reioycing ouer vs to do vs good,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1814:162"/> Ier. 32. 41. Pſal. 147. 11. and 14 9. 4. and to beautifie vs with ſaluation, Pſal. 149. 4. for what worke he beginneth, the ſame will he perfect to the end, Phil. 1. 6. For euery branch that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth fruite, the Father purgeth, that <hi>it may bring forth more fruit,</hi> Ioh. 15. 2. Such a branch then ſhall neuer wither or fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Therefore the worke of our ſaluation, being begun and continued of God, and not being our worke, but his, who can hinder our ſaluation? Fiftly, <hi>From Gods promiſes</hi> which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, neuer failing in any thing which he hath promiſed, Ioſ. 21. 45. and 23. 14, 15. 1. King. 8. 56. Now, he hath promiſed, Firſt, that he will neuer ſuffer his to be tempted aboue their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, 1. Cor. 10. 13. Secondly, that he will giue the iſſue with the temptation, that they may be able to beare it, 1. Cor. 10. 13. Thirdly, that though the iuſt man be ſo ouertaken, that he doth fall, yet ſhall he not be vtterly caſt downe, Pſal. 37. 24. Therefore cannot the Elect fall finally and periſh. Fourthly, <hi>From Gods power,</hi> who eſtabliſheth and keepeth vs from euill, 2. Theſſ. 3. 3. vpholdeth all that fall, and raiſeth them vp, Pſal. 145. 14. for he vpholdeth them with his hand, that they may not be vtterly caſt downe, Pſal. 37. 24. and ſo are kept by his power vnto ſaluation, 1. Pet. 1. Fifthly, therefore except a power be to ouermaſter Gods power, the Elect cannot periſh. Sixtly, and laſtly, <hi>From the prime cauſe of all this dealing of God thus with his people,</hi> why he hath thus decreed, couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, giuen gifts, wrought his worke, made ſuch promiſes, and ſo ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them: which is the good pleaſure of his will, Eph. 1. 5. his kindeneſſe, his loue and mercie, Tit. 3. 3, 5. Ioh. 3. 16. without any deſert of ours, Tit. 3. 5. Now, the ſame cauſe euerlaſtingly remaining in him, which moued him to chuſe vs, is that which continueth euer his goodneſſe towards vs, and therefore cannot the Elect finally periſh. Thus farre reaſons from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>From God the Sonne, Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> Firſt, he is not onely the Authour, but alſo the finiſher of our faith, Heb. 12. 2. Therefore our faith cannot be loſt. Secondly, in him <hi>all the building fitly framed together, groweth into a holy Temple,</hi> Eph. 2. 21. That therefore which groweth, doth not decay, nor can
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:1814:162"/> periſh. Thirdly, <hi>He ſaueth his people,</hi> Matth. 1. 21. <hi>loſeth nothing, nor caſteth any out that come to him,</hi> Ioh. 6. 37, 39. <hi>nor can any plucke them out of his hand, but he giueth to them eternall life,</hi> Ioh. 10. 28. How is it poſſible then that any of his ſhould periſh? Fourthly, He hath prayed God for all his (whom his Father hath giuen him, who either haue beleeued, or ſhall beleeue in him, Ioh. 17. 9, 20.) that he would keepe them through his Name, from euill, ver. 11. 15. and he alſo doth ſtill make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall interceſſion for his, Rom. 8. 34. Heb. 7. 25. and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for them in his Fathers preſence, Heb. 9. 24. Now, vnleſſe men will ſay, that Chriſts prayers are not heard, contrary to Ioh. 11. 42. and that God is not well pleaſed with him, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to Matth. 3. 17. it cannot be, that his faithfull children ſhould periſh and loſe their faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>From God the holy Ghoſt,</hi> who <hi>dwelleth in vs,</hi> 2. Tim. 1. 14. and <hi>abideth in vs,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2. 27. who is called <hi>Gods earneſt</hi> in our hearts, 2. Cor. 1. 22. and 5. 5. and ſo are we <hi>ſealed</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, Eph. 1. 13. and thus not here for a time, but euen <hi>vnto the day of Redemption,</hi> Eph. 4. 30. Therefore is it not poſſible for the Elect to periſh, except this earneſt of our God, and this his Heauenly Seale be of no validity.</p>
                  <p n="4">IIII. <hi>From the words of Scripture,</hi> ſpeaking ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of true Beleeuers ſaluation: <hi>He that beleeueth in the Sonne, hath euerlaſting life,</hi> Ioh. 3. 36. <hi>and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death vnto life,</hi> Ioh. 5 24. <hi>For through faith, by the power of God, they are kept vnto ſaluation,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 5. yea, <hi>the begotten of God keepeth himſelfe, and the wicked one toucheth him not,</hi> 1. Ioh. 5. 18. <hi>for the path of the iuſt is as a ſhining light, which ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day,</hi> Prou. 4 18. And <hi>thoſe that are planted in the Houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh, and ſtill bring forth fruite,</hi> Pſal. 92. 13, 14. Alſo, The righteous <hi>ſhall hold on his way,</hi> and <hi>be ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> Iob 17. 9. and nothing can ſeparate them from Gods loue in Chriſt Ieſus, Rom. 8. 38, 39.

For by faith the Saints haue endured tortures, cruell mockings, ſcourgings, bonds, impriſonments, ſtoning, ſawing aſunder, killing with the ſword, wandring in Sheep-skinnes, Goat-skinnes, being deſtitute, afflicted and tormented, wandring in mountaines,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:1814:163"/> dennes and caues of the earth, and yet for all this, were by faith more then Conquerors, Heb. 11. 35, 36, 37, 38. Rom. 8. 37. This is further manifeſt in all holy and conſtant Martyrs in all ages. Fifthly, it preuaileth againſt all the terrours of God, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe of mind, and deſperate apprehenſions; as we may ſee in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who being greatly diſquieted in mind, ſaid, <hi>O my ſoule, why art thou ſo diſquieted with me?</hi> preſently gaue anſwer as a remedy thereto, <hi>Truſt in God.</hi> Faith in God will allay all ſuch reſtleſneſſe of mans ſoule. In the 22. Pſalme, verſe 1. and 2. he ſaith, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> There he ſpeakes of his roaring and crying day and night, and yet God heard not. What was his comfort and ſtay, that he was not ſwallowed vp with deſpaire? Euen his faith, which both made him pray ſtill, and cry, <hi>My God, my God, O my God;</hi> yea challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging God for his God, <hi>Thou art my God,</hi> verſ. 10. And ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious was faith, that at length he triumphed with ioy, and ſaid, <hi>I will declare thy name to my brethren, and in the midſt of the congregation will I praiſe thee,</hi> verſ. 22. Of ſuch a force of faith may we obſerue in many Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Of this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable grace we haue a rare inſtance in <hi>Iob,</hi> who in a Sea of miſeries, when the venome of Gods arrowes was felt in his ſoule; when he ſaw God to ſet him as a marke to ſhoot at; when his wife grieued him, his friends vexed him, and Satan tryed him to the vttermoſt, and he left of all as comfortleſſe; euen then, euen then, in this gulph of his ſorrowes, and whirlepole of deſpaire, his faith made him not to faint; and therefore hee braſt forth in the midſt of theſe his vnſpeakeable calamities outward, and terrors inward, <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> So that great is the power of faith in deſperate caſes, and therefore being ſo victorious, it cannot be loſt.</p>

And as for <hi>Peter,</hi> it is cleere, that Chriſt prayed for him, that his faith ſhould not faile, as not finally, ſo not totally, Luk. 22. 31. For a true Beleeuer, in the day of his conuerſion, hath a new birth, Ioh. 3. 3. and his ſtate is compared to a reſurrection, and is called the firſt Reſurrection, Reu. 20. 6. Now, if a man truly regenerate, could wholy loſe his faith and godlineſſe, and yet after returne againe by repentance, beſides his firſt birth, and firſt reſurrection, there would bee ſo many births and reſurrections, as there be falls, and riſings againe: but the Scripture ſpeaketh but of one ſpirituall new birth; and here, of one reſurrection, and not of moe new births and reſurrections: for the firſt new birth they cannot loſe: for the ſeed of God doth remaine in them, 1. Ioh. 3. 9. and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death (which is damnation) hath no power on him, that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, Reu. 20. 6. But if ſuch a one could totally and finally fall away, it ſhould haue power on him, and he could not riſe againe vnto newneſſe of life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the truely Regenerate, though they fall, yea, and that ſometimes fearefully, yet fall they not totally, nor therefore can fall finally.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not denied of vs, but that ſome kinde of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers may fall way. This is not the queſtion; but, Whether true beleeuers hauing ſauing faith, and truely perſwaded of Gods mercy towards them, in Ieſus Chriſt, bringing forth liuely fruits of faith, can finally fall away? This is the queſtion, and not the other. To this place then I thus anſwer, That it ſpeaketh not of them that beleeue by a iuſtifying faith, which rooteth vs into Chriſt, but of an inferiour faith, as the words plainely teach: for it is ſaid, that they haue no roote, which <hi>for a while beleeue.</hi> Such indeed may, and doe fall away in time of trouble for Religion. Therefore it is weake and rootleſſe arguing, from the falling away of them which haue this rootleſſe faith, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the falling away of them which haue true ſound iuſtifying faith. For albeit ſauing faith includeth hiſtoricall and tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, yet be they not one and the ſame, but doe much differ, as before is manifeſted, and euen alſo out of this Parable: For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Temporarie</hi> faith is in them whoſe hearts are rocky and ſtony, Luk. 8. 13. but ſauing faith is in thoſe, whoſe hearts bee good and honeſt, verſe 15. Secondly, <hi>Temporarie</hi> faith is in them that receiue the Word immediately with a ſudden affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ioy, Mar. 4. 16. Matth. 13. 20. Ioh. 5. 35. but no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of ſound iudgement and vnderſtanding, or of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1814:165"/> minde to learne, vnderſtand and keepe it: But ſauing faith is in him that ſo heareth, that he doth vnderſtand it; in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, attendeth; &amp; intendeth in hearing, to vnderſtand. 3. <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary</hi> faith is in them, which haue no root in themſelues, Mat. 13. 21. nor moiſture, Luk. 8. 6. But, ſauing faith is in them that haue root, Epheſ. 3. 17. and are full of moiſture, maintained by the fountaine of Chriſts grace: for our of the belly of ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers ſhall flow riuers of liuing waters, Ioh. 7. 38. which ſhall ſpring vp to eternall life, Ioh. 4. 14. 4. <hi>Temporarie</hi> Faith they may haue, which yet want liuely fruits, though they may doe in ſhew many things, Mar. 6. 20. Therefore in this parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall expoſition, Chriſt mentioneth no fruits of this temporarie faith: but ſauing faith in them that haue it, beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, ſome an hundred, ſome ſixty, and ſome thirty fold, Matth. 13. 23. Mar. 4. 20.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>temporarie</hi> faith, in time of trouble and perſecution for the Words ſake, doth not preſerue ſuch beleeuers from being forth with offended thereat, Matth. 13. 21. Luk. 8. 13. But ſauing faith keepeth a true Chriſtian from taking ſuch an offence, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to keepe the Word, and to bring forth fruit with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Luk. 8. 15. in which patience they poſſeſſe their ſoules, and ſo fall not away. Therefore ſeeing there is ſuch difference betweene theſe, it will not follow, though temporarie faith fall away, that therefore ſauing faith ſhould fall away. And yet ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus muſt they conclude hence, or they conclude nothing out of this Text, for their purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Tim. 1. 19. <hi>Holding faith and a good conſcience, which ſome hauing put away, concerning faith, haue made ſhipwracke.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, here by faith is vnderſtood the doctrine of faith,<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:1814:165"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, if it be taken for the gift of faith, it muſt then bee vnderſtood of groundleſſe temporarie faith, which may bee loſt, and not of iuſtifying faith, which (as before is proued) cannot finally be loſt.</p>
                  <p>2. Tim. 2. 18. <hi>Who, concerning the truth, haue erred, ſaying, that the Reſurrection is past already, and ouerthrow the faith of ſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Faith is here put for the faith of the true doctrine concerning the Reſurrection, which by falſe Teachers was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and namely, by <hi>Hymenous</hi> and <hi>Philetus.</hi> Secondly, theſe ſome, whoſe faith was ouerthrowne, were not <hi>Elect,</hi> nor true Children of God: for in the next verſe 19. it is ſaid, <hi>Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, hauing the ſeale, The Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Though theſe falſe Teachers ouerthrow the faith of ſome, yet are theſe none of the Lords Elect, none of his adopted children, whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them is a ſure ſeale, &amp; an vnmoueable foundation, that they cannot periſh. Therefore theſe ſome, not being of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, their faith was not the faith of the Elect, nor faith of that kinde, but another faith of baſer mould, and ſo, not that ſauing faith, of which the queſtion is.</p>
                  <p>1. Tim. 6. 2. <hi>Which ſome profeſſing, haue erred concerning the faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Faith, as before, is here the ſound and wholeſome Doctrine of faith: For it is oppoſed to prophane and vaine bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, and oppoſitions of ſciences, falſely ſo called, verſe 20. Alſo the word <hi>erred,</hi> ſhewed as much; for errour is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Doctrine, and not of the gift of faith it ſelfe. And thus is <hi>Faith</hi> taken in 1. Tim. 4. 1.</p>
                  <p>Reuel. 2. 5. <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no mention of loſſe of faith, of which the queſtion is. Secondly, by falling, here is not to be vnderſtood of a totall, or finall falling away, but onely the decay of loue, not being in him in ſuch a degree, as at the firſt. For this Angell had yet very excellent graces in him, workes, labour, patience, zeale againſt falſe Teachers, hating thoſe whom God hated, hauing patience, and not fainted, Reuel. 2. 3, 6. If he fainted not, he had not loſt his faith. This place is therefore rather againſt our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:1814:166"/> then any thing for them. But our Gagger gazing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout without iudgement, where-euer hee found a word ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his fancy, though nothing to purpoſe; that hee will ſet downe. He ſhould haue remembred, that euery ſticke will not make a gagge for euery mouth.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 19. 24. <hi>Take from him the pound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a Parable, and therefore affordeth no ſound demonſtration by argument in a matter of controuerſie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if the words be to be vrged, he loſt not his pound, but it was taken from him; and then, when iudgement was to bee executed vpon him, Mat. 25. 30. Our queſtion is, of loſing it here before iudgement. Thirdly, by <hi>pound</hi> here, is not meant ſauing faith, of which the queſtion is, but ſome common graces affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Caſtawayes, ſuch as this man was, Matth. 25. 30. which if not wel vſed, or abuſed, God may depriue a man of. But where is it read, that God will take away his ſauing grace from any man, and damne them?</p>
                  <p>Matth. 25. 8. <hi>And the fooliſh ſaid vnto the wiſe, Giue vs of your oyle: for our Lamps are gone out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a parabolicall ſpeech, and therefore is not fit for argumentation, in a controuerted point. Secondly, by Lamps and Oyle, are meant not iuſtification, or iuſtifying faith, or adoption, or Chriſt being made our Wiſedome: for then could not the receiuers bee deciphered by the name of fooliſh Virgins. But ſome other more common graces, which in ſome receiuers vaniſh, in others are fed and increaſed vnto a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of life and light, putting them into a true ſtate of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This was only in the wiſe Virgins. The fooliſh had onely a falſe fire or blaze of ſome good beginning, which neuer came to growth: and herein they repreſent the Reprobates.</p>
                  <p>Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. <hi>It is impoſſible for thoſe which were once enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and haue taſted of the heauenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and haue taſted the good Word of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they ſhould fall away, to renew them againe to repentance, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is but a ſuppoſition, with an <hi>If they ſhould fall away.</hi> He teacheth not poſitiuely that ſuch may fall away. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:1814:166"/> grant that ſuch may fall away; It is meant of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and not of the Elect: For they here are ſaid to be enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and but to taſte of the heauenly gift and Word of God, &amp;c. But the Elect doe more then taſte: for they receiue it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, and concoct it, and finde nouriſhment and ſtrength there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Againe, theſe are ſuch as cannot be renued by repentance; which is ſuch a falling, as neuer happeneth to the Elect. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, theſe are ſuch as make a generall Apoſtacie, crucifying to themſelues afreſh the Sonne of God, and euen ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt; which the Elect in Chriſt cannot doe. So by this Text we ſee, that they which haue theſe gifts and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may fall totally from Chriſt. But there bee proper graces to the Elect, and ſuch things as accompany ſaluation, which as the Apoſtle was perſwaded, were in the Hebrewes, though he thus ſpake vnto them, verſe 9.</p>
                  <p>Ezek. 18. 24, 26. <hi>When a righteous man turneth away from his righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. There is a righteous man ſeeming ſo before men, Mat. 9. 13. but is not before God: ſuch a one may turne from his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and ſuch a one is here meant. For this righteous man here ſo falls, as that he may commit all the abominations that the wicked doth, verſe 24, and dye therein, verſe 26. and ſo apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate finally: but a righteous man before God, doth not ſo, for he ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day, Prou. 4. 18. and ſhall be in euerlaſting remembrance, Pſal. 112. 6. and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is bleſſed, Prou. 10. 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a double righteouſneſſe; the one Legall, and the other Euangelicall, which is the righteouſneſſe of faith, that is, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt applyed to vs by faith, and ſo made ours, which cannot be loſt, becauſe it is Chriſts. But the other may; and this is the righteouſneſſe which here the Prophet ſpeaketh of: For this righteouſneſſe is ſuch as is blotted out by ſinne, and which in the day of treſpaſſe ſhall not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as not being able to cleere him before God, verſ. 24. But Euangelicall righteouſnes is not blotted out in the day of mans tranſgreſſion, but is able to pacifie Gods wrath, and keepe the repentant in Gods fauour.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is in effect as much, counteruailing a particular promiſe, as if the true-hearted Beleeuer were perſonally named. The promiſes are propounded in general.

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, theſe and ſuch like promiſes in generall to all, include particular perſons. Whence it is, that ſometime they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſingularly in the ſecond perſon: <hi>If thou confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Ieſus, and beleeue in thine heart, thou ſhalt bee ſaued,</hi> Rom. 10. 9. <hi>Awake, thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall giue thee light,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 14. Thus ſpeaking as to particular men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods Miniſters, they come in Chriſts ſtead, 2. Cor. 5. 20. and doe alledge theſe faithfull promiſes of God made in generall, and apply them to their hearers, aſſuring them, that if they beleeue, theſe promiſes ſhall be certainly performed. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> applyed the promiſes, Act. 2. 38, 39. &amp; 3. 25, 26. So did S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 13. 26. &amp; 16. 31. which aſſurance made by faithfull Miniſters vpon theſe vndeceiueable promiſes of God, is to bee receiued and beleeued, as from Chriſts owne mouth; becauſe they ſpeake not vpon any warrant of their owne, but vpon the vndoubted warrant of Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Hearers (as many as be ordained to eternall life, Act. 13. 48. beleeuing, doe apprehend, and by faith doe apply to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:1814:167"/> themſelues theſe promiſes ſo deliuered, for that they know that they doe beleeue, and truely repent; of which their conſcience beareth witneſſe; whoſe heart is ſo ſeaſoned with grace, and conformed to Gods voice, as the ſame like an Eccho anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thereto: So that when God ſaith, <hi>Seeke ye my face,</hi> the faithfull ſoule anſwereth to God, <hi>Thy face, Lord, will I ſeeke,</hi> Pſal. 27. 8. When God ſaith, <hi>Thou art my people,</hi> it ſoundeth backe, <hi>Thou art the Lord my God,</hi> Zach. 13. 9. When Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If thou beleeueſt, al things are poſſible to him that beleeueth,</hi> he anſwereth, <hi>Lord, I beleeue, helpe my vnbeliefe,</hi> Mar. 9. 23. When God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his will to be done, and his commandements diligently to be kept, the gracious ſoule is moued with deſire therto, <hi>Oh, that my wayes were directed to the keeping of thy Statutes,</hi> Pſal. 119. 4, 5. and ſhewes it ſelfe ready, <hi>Loe, I come, O God, I am content to doe it, yea, thy Law is within my heart,</hi> Pſal. 40. 7, 8. Therefore their faith claimeth theſe promiſes, and concludeth the aſſurance of the things promiſed in particular ſo to themſelues, as if they in the ſame promiſes were perſonally named.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to this ſpirit of true Beleeuers the holy Ghoſt bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth witneſſe, Rom. 8. 16. and it is true, 1. Ioh. 5. 6. that wee are the ſonnes of God, Rom. 8. 16. and that God hath giuen to vs eternall life, 1. Ioh. 5. 11. which true Beleeuers doe know: for the Word was written alſo, that this they ſhould know, 1. Ioh. 5. 13. Thus we ſee, how a true Beleeuer hath his particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, not from an idle fantaſie, or vaine conceit, but from the vndoubted Word of God, and from the faithfull witneſſes of Gods Spirit, and his owne conſcience. If our Aduerſaries will be yet obſtinate, and ſay, that theſe generall promiſes cannot bee thus particularly applyed; I demand foure things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, why is it ſaid, Rom. 15. 4. Whatſoeuer things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aforetime, were written for our learning, that wee through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures, might haue hope? and in Rom. 4. 23, 24. That the things written, were not written for their ſakes onely, of whom they were ſpoken, but for vs alſo, if we cannot apply them as ſpoken to euery one.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, why haue the Apoſtles applyed the generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to particular perſons, ſo as they haue done, as before is
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1814:168"/> ſhewed, Act. 3. 26. &amp; 16. 31. &amp; 13. 26. and why haue they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the faithfull in generall, with a promiſe made to one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in particular, Ioſ. 1. 9. Heb. 13. 5? And why did <hi>Zachary</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude himſelfe in thoſe promiſes made long before to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſpoken to himſelfe and thoſe then liuing, Luk. 1. 73, 74. if faith might not apply them to a beleeuers owne ſpeciall comfort?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how can the Popiſh Prieſts, from a generall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Ioh. 20. 23. with ſuch authoritie abſolue their particular Penitentiaries? And are either thoſe Prieſts, or any of their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiaries named in the Text? If vpon ſo generall words they can be bold to aſſure their Confitents of pardon of ſinnes, may not a true Beleeuer, vpon the forenamed grounds, hee aſſured particularly of his owne ſaluation?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if there can be no aſſured application, without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular nomination, how ſhall men become obedient to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and commandements of God? how ſhall any bee ſtirred vp by exhortation? how ſhall any bee terrified by threatnings? For in none of theſe is any man perſonally named, more then in the promiſes. Therefore as in hearing the other, we apply them, and verily take them without any doubt, as ſpoken to vs in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to worke obedience and feare: ſo in hearing theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are we to apply them, as ſpoken to vs by name, if we true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue to our heauenly comfort, and aſſurance of life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                     </label> Secondly, they ſay, that Gods Decree, whence we fetch the ground of aſſurance, is conditionall, If we beleeue; If we liue, as we ought to liue, and perſeuer to the end. Which perſeuerance when God foreſeeth in vs, doth thereupon elect vs to ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Decree is abſolute according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Gods owne will. For therefore we beleeue, becauſe hee ſo hath ordained it, Act. 13. 48. We walke in good workes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſo fore-ordained vs thereto, Epheſ. 2. 10. We are in time called, iuſtified, made conformable to Chriſt, adopted for children, to bring forth fruit, that alſo the ſame ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and ſo be at length glorified, becauſe he hath predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ordained vs thereto, Rom. 8. 30. Epheſ. 1. 5. Ioh. 15. 16. So as his Decree is the cauſe of all good to vs, and not our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and perſeuerance the cauſe of his Decree.</p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:1814:168"/>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                     </label> Thirdly, this Doctrine of the certainty of ſaluation, and that faith cannot faile, maketh men ſecure, &amp; careleſs of good works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a very old obiection, but altogether ſlanderous. There is indeed to be granted a kind of ſecurity or aſſuredneſſe, being vnderſtood ſpiritually; for it maketh vs ſecure in God, in the infiniteneſſe of his mercy towards vs through Chriſt, in the vndoubted truth of his promiſes, in the full &amp; perfect ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by Chriſt, and in the vnchangeableneſſe of Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Decree, to ſaue all thoſe which truely beleeue in Chriſt. But this Doctrine maketh them not carnally ſecure, which are vpon ſolid ground, aſſured of their ſaluation, which is thus manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this ſauing faith, as you haue heard, is euer accompanied with other graces, which maketh the true Beleeuers neither barren nor vnfruitfull, 2. Pet. 1. 5, 8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this precious faith doth not onely claime the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, but humbly attendeth vpon Gods will, in vſing ſuch meanes, as God hath appointed in the way to Heauen.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is euident from examples in Scripture, of ſuch as were certaine of ſaluation, as <hi>Abraham, Moſes, Dauid,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> and others, that they did not therefore neglect their duties. And ſuch with vs, as conſcionably hold this doctrine, doe walke nothing leſſe carefully in the wayes of Gods Commandements, but doe endeuour to keepe a good conſcience towards God and men. And what if vaine preſumptuous ſpirits abaſe this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as they doe other holy and wholeſome truths, to their condemnation? is the Doctrine therefore faulty? Shall the abuſe of truth make it to be iudged falſhood. God forbid.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, this Doctrine of aſſurance, is moſt comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to humbled and afflicted ſoules, as the other is full of ſlauiſh feare, and very comfortleſſe. For what can bee more terrour to mans heart, in the time of temptation, when hee hath fallen by infirmitie ſuddenly into ſome grieuous offence, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, and being aſſaulted by Satan to deſpaire, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, then to be perſwaded, that Gods Decree dependeth vpon mans perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, that the couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Grace made with his ſoule may be annihilated, his promiſes fallible, his power fruſtrated, Chriſts ſtrength too feeble to vphold him, Chriſts prayers not of force
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:1814:169"/> to preuaile for him with Gods, the holy Spirit to haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him, the Seale of Gods Couenant broken off, the writing cancelled, Faith it ſelfe, and the hope of heauen loſt for euer? This wounded ſpirit, this ſoule thus perplexed, this heart thus affrighted, caſt into ſuch a deepe gulph of deſpaire, who can but pittie, and withall beware of that deſperate Doctrine, which caſteth poore ſoules into ſuch vnexpreſſible miſery and ſorrows of heart?</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, by the Doctrine of aſſurance of ſaluation, when a poore weake Chriſtian hath beene ouertaken by ſome violent ſtorme of temptation, and commeth to the ſight of ſin, with <hi>Dauid,</hi> cryeth &amp; calleth with bitter teares of repentance, and faine would finde peace with God againe, how comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will it be in ſuch a diſtreſſe, when Satan with his fiery darts aſſaulteth him, to thinke, that though he hath failed on his part, and ſo vndone himſelfe for euer, as much as lyeth in him, yet that God is one and the ſame, his Decree vnalterable, his Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant not broken on his part, Chriſt ſtill his Sauiour, his prayers prevalent for him, the Spirit of God exciting him to prayer, with groanes not to be expreſſed, and his faith though ſhaken, yet not loſt? O how will the meditation hereof comfort ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſpirit, &amp; turne his heart to ſeeke after God, grieuing with himſelf that he ſhould diſpleaſe ſo gracious a God, and after he hath once againe found ſome comfort, to put on a reſolution ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to offend ſo any more, &amp; in a holy zeale therefore to auenge himſelfe on himſelfe, bringing downe his fleſh in ſubiection to the Spirit; and all this, with an earneſt loue to God, and care to pleaſe him, euen for that he hath not loſt, through his fall, the aſſurance of his ſaluation, as iuſtly he had deſerued? Thus is this Doctrine a comfort in diſtreſſe, and an incouragement after a fall, to riſe againe, and in the time of greateſt peace, neuer any cauſe of careleſſe ſecuritie, but rather of ſpirituall ioy, and an incitement to well-doing, to expreſſe all thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God, through Chriſt, for the ſame. Euen ſo, <hi>Amen.</hi>
